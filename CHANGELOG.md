# Changelog

## 0.14.0 (unreleased)

This release brings Flow Designer troubleshooting, code search, and background scripts to the terminal, along with more login options and resumable record exports.

### New commands

- **`sn flow`** — browse flows, inspect their steps and version history, and investigate executions with logs, live updates, and checks for why a flow did not run.
- **`sn codesearch`** — search scripts and code across your instance, with filters for a table or application scope.
- **`sn script run`** — run server-side JavaScript from a file, stdin, or the command line and get its output and errors as JSON. Supports application scopes and recording changes for rollback.
- **`sn impersonate`** — run one command as another user to investigate what their permissions allow.
- **`sn doctor`** — check your connection, identity, and required roles, plugins, or properties before starting a job.
- **`sn decision` / `sn playbook`** — inspect and evaluate decision tables, or list and start playbook executions. Playbook `launch` has not yet been verified successfully on a live instance.
- **`sn cache`** — save table and column names locally for offline lookups and optional shell completion with `sn completion <shell> --dynamic`.
- **More ways to sign in:** use JWT-based OAuth or tokens supplied by another tool. Browser login can use the ServiceNow SDK's client when available; your own OAuth client is still recommended.
- **Resumable exports:** interrupted `sn table list --all` JSONL exports can return a `resume_from` value to continue with `--resume-from`.
- **Everyday shortcuts:** `sn open <table>` opens a list view, `sn get` looks up custom record-number prefixes when permitted, and profile output shows stored proxy and TLS settings.

### Breaking

- `sn table list --all` now exports in `sys_id` order. Add an `ORDERBY` query clause or use `--paginate offset` if you need offset pagination.
- Offset exports with `--all` reject `--no-count` and `--suppress-pagination-header`; remove those flags or use the default pagination.
- A bulk-export response missing its record array now exits 3 instead of ending successfully. Error objects may also include `resume_from`.
- `sn profile add --force` resets stored proxy and TLS options to the flags supplied. Repeat any proxy or certificate options you want to keep; omitting `--insecure` restores verification unless it is enabled elsewhere.
- Replacing an OAuth profile clears its cached tokens. For browser-based OAuth, run `sn profile login` again.
- A bare-number `sn get` lookup can now report the record's child table in its `table` field. Use `table:number` to keep the table explicit.

### Fixed

- Bulk exports continue past pages emptied by record permissions and use pagination that avoids shifts caused by inserting or deleting earlier rows.

### Security

- Diagnostic output masks `X-UserToken` headers and passwords embedded in proxy URLs.

See the [release guide](https://github.com/tehubersheezy/servicenow-cli/blob/v0.14.0/docs/releases/0.14.0.md) for examples, requirements, and limitations.

## 0.13.2 (2026-08-31)

### Added
- **`sn gr <table>`** — record reads compiled to GraphQL, so reference fields dot-walk in one round trip: `sn gr incident -f number,caller_id.manager.email -q "active=true"`. Results come back flattened to the dotted keys, piping like `sn table list`; `--count` emits just the matching row count; `--display-value` works as everywhere. `sn graphql` remains the passthrough for everything else (#99).

## 0.13.1 (2026-08-19)

### Added
- API-key authentication: `sn init --auth apikey` and `sn profile add --auth apikey` (with `--api-key` / `--api-key-stdin`) store a ServiceNow inbound REST API key and send it as the `x-sn-apikey` header on every request — no username, password, or OAuth client needed. The key is verified against the instance before the profile is saved, lives in `credentials.toml` (0600), and `sn profile show` / `sn profile status` report `auth: "apikey"` and `hasApiKey` without ever printing the key.

## 0.13.0 (2026-08-18)

### Added

- **`sn get <REF>`** — one record with its catalog variables and journal entries, by reference: `sn get incident:INC0010001`, `sn get incident:<sys_id>`, or a bare number with a standard prefix (`sn get SIR0010001`; INC, CHG, CTASK, PRB, REQ, RITM, SCTASK, KB, SIR). Resolution and the journal ride one GraphQL request; a number that cannot be resolved fails loudly instead of matching an arbitrary record.
- Every `(table, sys_id)` pair also accepts the combined `table:sys_id` / `table:number` reference as a single argument: `table get/update/delete`, `journal`, `open`, `variables get/set`, `cmdb get/update`, `cmdb relation add/delete`, and `attachment upload --record` (which then needs no `--table`). The implied-verb shorthand reads it too: `sn table incident:INC0010001` is a `get`.
- `sn context` shows the instance-side session context — the application scope and update set the caller's tracked writes are captured under — in one API round trip. `sn context scope <name|sys_id>` and `sn context updateset <name|sys_id>` switch them, verified by re-read. A stale update-set preference is reported (`source`, `preference_stale`) rather than silently healed.

### Breaking

- `sn auth` is merged into `sn profile`: `login`, `logout`, `status` and `refresh` are now `sn profile <verb>`. Flags and output are unchanged; the `auth` group is gone.
- `sn watch` targets with `-q <QUERY>` alone. `--sys-id` is removed — write `-q "sys_id=<SYS_ID>"`. `--hydrate`, `--fields` and `--display-value` are removed with no replacement: an event already carries every changed field's new value as a `{display_value, value}` pair, and a hydrated row was the row as of the fetch, so back-to-back writes hydrated the first event with the second's values. Read fields the write didn't touch with `sn table get`.
- Introspect schema: the `sys_id` positional on the reference-taking commands is now optional, and `attachment upload --table` is no longer required — regenerate any cached agent/MCP schemas.
- `table get/update/delete` now validate the table name and sys_id (lowercase identifier; sys_id charset) instead of passing arbitrary strings into the URL.
- Building from source needs Rust 1.88: the declared `rust-version` had lagged what the dependency tree already required; it now matches reality and CI enforces it.

### Fixed

- `sn change list` (and `models`/`templates`) returns records only: the Change API's trailing `__meta` element is stripped from the array, so `length` matches the record count (`--output raw` keeps it). Query terms the instance silently dropped become a stderr warning naming them.
- `sn change list -q` refuses `ORDERBY` clauses up front: the Change API silently discards them and returns arbitrary order. The error points at `sn table list change_request`, which sorts correctly.
- `sn watch` no longer loses events to the instance's session reaper. The watcher replaces its session every 45 seconds (`--session-rotate <SECS>`, 0 disables) with a make-before-break handoff: the replacement subscribes before the old session disconnects, the old socket is drained, and the overlap is deduplicated. A routine reap opens no gap and writes no marker; markers now indicate genuine failures only.

### Security

- `h2` updated past RUSTSEC-2026-0258 (unbounded empty DATA frames, low severity), with the rest of the dependency tree swept to current versions.

## 0.12.1 (2026-08-13)

### Breaking

- `sn watch` is a single form: `sn watch <TABLE> (-q <QUERY> | --sys-id <SYS_ID>)`. Drop the word `table` from existing invocations; every flag is unchanged. The `count`, `activity` and `channel` subcommands are removed — `activity` delivered no events, and a `count` delta stream that dies mid-watch accumulates a silently wrong total.

### Fixed

- `sn watch` no longer goes silently dead when the instance invalidates its session (a minute or two in, on instances that reap API sessions): the watcher detects the invalidation, reconnects on a fresh session, and marks the gap with the usual `sn_watch: reconnected` line. Previously it kept polling the dead session forever, delivered nothing, and exited 0.
- A refused AMB subscription (bad table, bad query) no longer reports `status_code: 400`. The refusal is in-band; no HTTP error occurred, so no status is published.

## 0.12.0 (2026-08-12)

### New commands

- **`sn api list|search|spec`** — search the instance's own REST API catalogue and export any API's OpenAPI 3 spec, YAML included. `sn api search attachment` returns every matching endpoint with its method and route, so "is there an API for this?" no longer needs a browser.
- **`sn graphql <QUERY>`** — run a GraphQL document against the instance's whole GraphQL surface, including the generated per-table query and mutation namespaces. The document comes inline, from `@file`, or on stdin; `--var` and `--variables` bind variables. GraphQL reports failure inside a 200, so an `errors` array maps to exit 2 with any partial `data` still on stdout.
- **`sn journal <TABLE> <SYS_ID>`** — a record's comments and work notes as structured entries, newest first, readable under a non-admin role. `--comments`, `--work-notes` and `--limit` narrow the result.
- **`sn variables get|set <TABLE> <SYS_ID>`** — read and write catalog variables on a request item or a record producer's target. Every `set` re-reads the record afterwards and reports what actually changed, so a write the platform silently skips is exit 2 rather than a false success.

### Breaking

- `--all` with `--output raw` or `--output table` is now exit 1. Use `--array` for table output.
- `profile remove`, `catalog cart-empty`, `catalog cart-remove`, `change conflict remove`, `updateset back-out` and `app rollback` require `--yes` when stdin is not a terminal.
- `sn ping`'s `username` is the identity the instance reports, not the configured one.

### Fixed

- `sn cmdb create` and `sn cmdb update` work. Writes go out as the IRE envelope the CMDB API requires, with a `--source` defaulting to `Manual Entry`.
- `sn ping` and `sn user me` report the caller the instance names, instead of occasionally returning an unrelated user's record.
- Concurrent `sn` invocations no longer lose each other's config writes, and a crash mid-write no longer leaves a torn config file.
- A config file that cannot be read is an error, rather than loading as empty and being saved back that way.
- Parallel OAuth refreshes are single-flight, so token rotation no longer 401s one of them.
- `sn attachment download` streams — 800 MB at 19 MB peak RSS. `--out` writes atomically, leaving an existing file untouched on failure, and `--timeout` is now a per-read idle timeout rather than a cap on the whole transfer.
- `--output table` is honored by `aggregate`, `scores list`, `scores favorite` and `open`.
- `--wait` honors `--output raw`.
- `status_code` is omitted rather than reported as `0` when a failure carried no HTTP status.
- `scores unfavorite`, `profile use` and `profile remove` emit JSON.
- `sn init` names flags it actually accepts when stdin is not a terminal.
- `sn watch` writes a `{"sn_watch":"reconnected",…}` line for the gap a reconnect leaves, and `--idle-timeout` measures subscribed time rather than wall clock.
- `--setLimit` is accepted alongside `--setlimit`, and `--help` names the `--limit` alias.
- Large `--array` payloads are buffered and flushed once; streamed output still flushes per record.

### Security

- `credentials.toml` and `config.toml` are created 0600 by `open(2)` itself. `config.toml` was 0644 and is repaired on the first write from this release.
- `webbrowser` 1.2.4 clears RUSTSEC-2026-0257. No `sn` call site was reachable.

## 0.11.0 (2026-08-04)

Two threads run through this release. The command surface gets the ergonomics a caller
expects: the read verb is optional on `table` and `cmdb`, every argument is documented,
`--help` is organized rather than exhaustive, and one write verb that never did what its
name implied is gone. And `sn introspect` — the machine-readable face of that surface —
becomes something you can generate schemas from: 73% smaller, free of the phantom nodes
that made up most of it, and carrying the argument constraints a generator needs.

### Breaking changes

- **`sn table replace` and `sn cmdb replace` are gone. Use `update`.** They issued PUT
  where `update` issues PATCH, and ServiceNow treats both as partial updates — so the
  two verbs did the same thing while implying they did not. Measured on a live instance
  by writing one field to two identical records, one per verb: both moved exactly the
  field written plus the same three derived columns (`sys_mod_count`, `sys_updated_on`,
  `activity_due`), and PUT blanked none of the ten fields it omitted. Same result on
  `/api/now/cmdb/instance`. Anything calling `replace` should call `update` with the
  same body; no other change is needed.

- **`--display-value` now defaults to `true`.** Reference and choice fields come back as
  readable labels (`"Software"`, `"In Progress"`) instead of sys_ids and numeric codes.
  Applies to `table`, `change`, `aggregate`, and `scores`; `sn watch` is unaffected,
  since its `--display-value` only narrows a `--hydrate` fetch.

  Two consequences worth knowing. Dates and times are also rewritten, into the calling
  user's timezone and locale format (`2026-08-04 14:22:01` becomes `08/04/2026 10:22:01
  AM`), and a display-formatted date cannot be fed back into an encoded query. And a
  reference field yields a name rather than the sys_id you would need to chain into
  another call. Pass **`--display-value false`** for the old raw output, or
  **`--display-value all`** for both (each field becomes a `{value, display_value}`
  object).

- **`sn introspect` emits the global flags once at the root, not on every command.** The
  root gains `global_args`; each node's `args` now holds only that command's own
  arguments. **A command's effective flags are its own `args` plus the root's
  `global_args`** — non-global arguments do not propagate, so there is no ancestor chain
  to walk. Anything generating per-command schemas needs to union the two.

  clap propagates the 11 globals onto every node, and that repetition was most of what
  the tree contained: of 0.10.0's 1,852 argument entries, 1,353 were those same 11 flags
  repeated and another 124 were `--help`/`--version` stubs — 80% of the output, leaving
  375 entries that described anything command-specific. Together with the phantom-node
  fix below, the tree drops from 486 KB to 129 KB.

### Added

- **The read verb may be omitted on `table` and `cmdb`.** `sn table incident <sys_id>` is
  `get`, `sn table incident` is `list`, and the same for `sn cmdb <class> [sys_id]`. Both
  groups map to a REST path that is already `{noun}/{id}`, so for a read the verb is
  implied by the method. (Reported as #23, where an agent wrote exactly this form and got
  `unrecognized subcommand 'sc_cat_item'` with nothing to act on.)

  Only `get` and `list` are ever inferred — never a write — and the choice is decided, not
  guessed: `get` requires a second positional and `list` rejects one, so exactly one of
  them can parse any given argv. A misspelled verb is still a misspelled verb:
  `sn table lst incident` keeps clap's `tip: a similar subcommand exists: 'list'` rather
  than fetching from a table named `lst`. Groups with non-CRUD subcommands (`change`,
  `catalog`) are excluded, since there the first token is not reliably a noun.

- **`sn raw -H/--header 'Name: Value'`** — send request headers on the REST passthrough,
  curl-style and repeatable. Endpoints that need one (`X-no-response-body`, Scripted REST
  API custom headers, `Accept` negotiation, `X-UserToken`) were previously unreachable,
  since `sn raw` could only vary method, path, query, and body.

  Caller headers are applied last, after the client's own, so they win — `Content-Type`
  included. Repeating a name sends it twice. A malformed header is a usage error (exit 1),
  not a panic.

  `Authorization` is refused: a profile is the whole unit of identity in this CLI, and a
  credential passed in argv is visible to `ps` and to shell history. Configure identity
  with `sn init` or `sn profile add`.

  Both directions stay JSON regardless of the headers set. Responses are parsed as JSON,
  so `Accept: text/xml` fetches XML and then fails to parse; `--data`/`--field` always
  serialize JSON, so `Content-Type: application/xml` only mislabels a JSON body.

- **`-p` as a short alias for `--profile`.** Global, so `sn -p prod table list incident`
  and `sn table list incident -p prod` are equivalent.

- **`sn introspect` emits the constraints a schema generator needs.** Each `args[]` entry
  gains `conflicts_with` (the arg ids that cannot be combined with it — `--data` alongside
  `--field` is exit 1), `value_name` (the `SECS`/`URL`/`PATH` placeholder `--help` shows),
  and `help_heading` (`Global options`, `Advanced options`, or `null` for a command's
  working set). The root gains `version`, so a consumer caching generated schemas can
  invalidate them on an upgrade.

  One relation stays out of reach: clap keeps `requires` private, so `--wait-timeout`
  requiring `--wait` is still only prose in that flag's `help`.

### Fixed

- **`unrecognized subcommand` now names the subcommands that exist.** clap only offers a
  suggestion when the bad token is within edit distance of a real one, which a table name
  never is — so `sn change sc_cat_item abc` printed a usage line and nothing else. The
  error now appends `` `sn change` subcommands: list, get, create, … `` for every group.

- **`sn introspect` no longer emits clap's generated `help` subcommand.** clap generates
  one at every level that has subcommands, and each mirrors its whole subtree as
  argument-less stubs — **274 of 0.10.0's 397 nodes were phantoms.** Most of the tree
  described nothing callable, and every real command had a same-named twin: `sn help table
  list` sat beside `sn table list` with an empty `args`, indistinguishable to a schema
  generator. Any recursive walk — including the one `docs/agent-guide.md` prescribed —
  saw mostly phantoms. The tree is now 121 nodes, all of them real.

  `--help` and `--version` are dropped from `args[]` too. They exit before any handler
  runs, so there is nothing for a generated tool to call. The filter keys on clap's
  *action*, not the argument name, because `sn app install --version <VERSION>` is a real
  value-taking option that a name-based filter would have deleted.

- **`sn introspect` honors the global output flags it accepts.** `--pretty`, `--compact`,
  and `--output table` all parsed and were then discarded, because the command hardcoded
  its own formatter instead of routing through the shared `write_response`. It also built
  its tree from `Cli::command()` rather than `cli::command()`, so it described a command
  tree whose usage lines differed from the one `--help` renders.

### Changed

- **`--help` is organized instead of exhaustive.** The 11 global flags used to be
  interleaved with each command's own — clap gives every argument container its own
  display-order counter and merges them, which zippered `--profile`/`--output`/`--pretty`
  through the middle of `--query`/`--fields`/`--setlimit`. They now sit in their own
  `Global options` section below the command's flags, on all 120 subcommands. Raw
  `sysparm_*` passthroughs most callers never touch (`--view`, `--query-category`,
  `--query-no-domain`, `--no-count`, `--suppress-pagination-header`,
  `--exclude-reference-link`) moved to `Advanced options`. `sn scores list` additionally
  splits its score-series flags into `Score data options`.

- **Every flag and positional now has help text.** 123 arguments across 54 commands had
  none — `sn table get --help` listed `<TABLE>`, `<SYS_ID>` and five flags with blank
  descriptions. All 362 command-specific arguments and all 11 globals are documented now,
  and `sn introspect` is the audit: a test walks the tree and fails on any null `help`.

- **Usage lines put `[OPTIONS]` last**: `sn table get <TABLE> <SYS_ID> [OPTIONS]`, which
  is the order people type. Parsing is unchanged — flags are still accepted in any
  position, before or after positionals and before or after the subcommand.

## 0.10.0 (2026-07-14)

### Breaking changes

- **`sn watch table` no longer reads the record for each event.** An AMB event already
  carries the fields that changed *and their new values*: `record` holds every field
  named in `changes` as a `{display_value, value}` pair, plus five `sys_*` audit columns.
  0.9.1 fetched the record anyway — one Table API read per event — and overwrote `record`
  with the result. The event's own record is now emitted as-is, and no API call is made.

  Pass **`--hydrate`** for the old behavior: one Table API read per event, replacing
  `record` with the whole row. Use it when you need fields that did *not* change. An event
  about `state` carries no `number` and no `assigned_to`, because they were not written.

  `--fields` and `--display-value` now require `--hydrate`, since they only affect that
  fetch; accepting them without it would silently do nothing. `--no-hydrate` is still
  accepted and does nothing, as it now describes the default.

  Note that a hydrated record is the row as of the *fetch*, not as of the event. A record
  written twice in quick succession can hydrate the first event with the second event's
  values. The event's own record has no such skew.

### Fixed

- **The docs claimed AMB events carry no field values.** They do, and always did — the
  claim ("its payload carries only `sys_*` columns, never what they changed to") was in
  the README, both skills, and `watch.rs` itself, and it is what put hydration on by
  default in 0.9.1. Corrected everywhere, verified against a live instance.

## 0.9.1 (2026-07-13)

Adds `sn watch`: live record watchers. Record changes are streamed over ServiceNow's
AMB websocket as they happen, as JSONL on stdout, one event per line.

### Added

- **`sn watch table <TABLE> --query <ENCODED_QUERY>`** — stream changes to every record
  matching the query. `--sys-id <SYS_ID>` watches a single record.
- **`sn watch count <TABLE> --query <ENCODED_QUERY>`** — stream changes to the number of
  records matching the query.
- **`sn watch activity <SYS_ID>`** — stream a record's comments, work notes and field
  changes.
- **`sn watch channel <CHANNEL>`** — subscribe to a raw AMB channel, for channels the
  CLI does not model.
- **`--operation insert|update|delete`** and **`--on-change <FIELDS>`** filter the
  stream. **`--max-events <N>`**, **`--duration <SECS>`** and **`--idle-timeout <SECS>`**
  bound it. Ctrl-C exits 0.

### Notes

- `sn watch count` reports a delta, not a total (`{"count": "+1"}`). Seed it with
  `sn aggregate <TABLE> --count --query <ENCODED_QUERY>` and accumulate.
- Proxies are not supported. The websocket is opened directly rather than through the
  HTTP client, so a profile with a proxy configured exits 1 instead of connecting around
  it. `--insecure` and `--ca-cert` are honored.

## 0.9.0 (2026-07-12)

Creating a profile was only ever possible through `sn init` — a wizard that prompts
for whatever you left out, reports its result to a human on stderr, and claims
`default_profile` when none is set. Scripting it meant hoping you'd passed enough
flags to keep it from blocking on a read that would never be answered. This release
splits the job in two: `sn init` stays the onboarding wizard, and `sn profile add`
becomes the scriptable half.

### Added

- **`sn profile add [NAME]`** — register a profile without the wizard. It emits JSON
  on stdout, and **never prompts when stdin is not a terminal**: a missing field is
  exit 1 naming the flag that supplies it, so it cannot hang a pipeline. It refuses
  to overwrite an existing profile (exit 1; `--force` opts in), and it leaves
  `default_profile` alone — `--set-default`, or `sn profile use`, does that
  deliberately. `--non-interactive` forces the fail-fast behavior on a terminal too.
- **`sn profile add --password-stdin` / `--client-secret-stdin`** pipe a secret in
  rather than passing it on the command line, where `ps` and shell history can see
  it. (`sn init` has neither; it prompts.)
- **`sn profile add --no-verify`** registers a profile without any network call, for
  air-gapped provisioning or config management that runs before the instance is
  reachable.

### Breaking changes

- **`sn init` now always claims `default_profile`.** It previously set it only when
  no default existed, which made "set up my connection" quietly do nothing to a
  machine that already had one. Onboarding onto a profile now means using it. Use
  `sn profile add` to register an instance *without* repointing your commands.

### Fixed

- **Login reported the wrong person.** `sn auth login` and `sn init --auth oauth`
  named the authenticated user by reading `sys_user` with `sysparm_limit=1` — which
  returns whichever row happens to sort first, an arbitrary account that was never
  the caller. The identity now comes from `gs.getUserName()` server-side, the way
  `sn user me` always did.
- **A profile that fails verification is no longer left on disk.** `sn init` wrote
  the config files first and checked the credentials second, so a typo'd password
  left a broken identity behind — and, on a machine with no default yet, made it the
  default. Both commands now roll the write back, so a failed `add`/`init` leaves no
  profile and changes no default.
- **`sn init` no longer invents a bogus instance.** With a non-terminal stdin the
  instance prompt read EOF as an empty answer, which `normalize_instance` then turned
  into the bare suffix `.service-now.com` — a *non-empty* string, so the
  `instance is required` guard never fired and was in effect dead code. A scripted
  `sn init --username u --password p` therefore wrote a profile named `default`
  pointing at `https://.service-now.com`, made it the default, and only *then* failed
  resolving it. Missing fields now name themselves (exit 1), an empty instance stays
  empty, and nothing is written.
- **`sn attachment download` panicked on every invocation.** Exit 101, flag or no
  flag, since the command shipped. Its local `--output <PATH>` (a string) collided
  with the CLI-wide `--output default|raw|table` (an enum): clap merges arguments by
  id, so the local definition shadowed the global one's type and the parser then
  tried to read an `OutputMode` out of a `String`. **The destination flag is now
  `--out` / `-o`** — `--output` keeps its CLI-wide meaning everywhere. Nothing
  exercised `attachment download`, so a total crash went unnoticed across releases;
  it has tests now.
- **`sn open` emitted a URL with no scheme.** Profiles store the bare host, and
  `open` interpolated it straight into the link, producing
  `acme.service-now.com/nav_to.do?...` — which no browser will open. It now goes
  through the same `normalize_base_url` the HTTP client uses. This affected every
  profile created the documented way; nothing exercised `sn open`, so it went
  unnoticed. There are tests now.
- **`sn progress -d` printed no percentage.** ServiceNow sends `percent_complete` as
  a JSON string on some operations and a number on others; the code only read the
  string form and silently skipped the rest.
- **`sn ping` printed an empty username on OAuth profiles.** An OAuth profile stores
  no username — the identity is in the token — so `ping` reported `""`. It now asks
  the instance. Basic profiles still report their configured username, which is what
  proves a stray environment variable didn't swap the credentials out.

### Docs

An adversarial pass over the docs — every claim executed against the compiled
binary and a live instance — found six response shapes that were **invented**, and
that would silently mislead any agent trusting them. All corrected, with the real
shapes captured verbatim:

- `schema tables` puts the table name in **`value`**, not `name` — `jq -r '.[].name'`
  returned `null` for every row.
- `schema columns` has no `choice_field` and no `default_value`; the default is
  `default`, and a choice column is `type: "choice"` with its options inlined in a
  `choices[]` array.
- `aggregate --group-by` returns an **array**, and `groupby_fields` is a *sibling* of
  `stats`, not a member — the documented `jq '.stats.groupby_fields[]'` matched
  nothing.
- `change` returns every field as a **`{display_value, value}` pair**, so `.number` is
  an object, not a string. `change nextstates` returns an object keyed by
  `available_states`/`state_label`, not a list of `{value, label}`.
- `cmdb get` nests the CI's fields under **`.attributes`**.
- `scores list` returns `direction`/`frequency` as **integer codes**; the words live
  in `direction_label`/`frequency_label`.
- `introspect` emits a **recursive tree** (`{name, about, args[], subcommands[]}`).
  There is no `.commands[]`, and the documented `jq` recipe failed outright.
- The `--wait` recipe read the command's stdout on its failure branch, where stdout
  is **empty** (the progress object goes to stderr), and matched on `status_label` —
  a verbatim ServiceNow string that varies by instance, which is how you write a poll
  loop that never terminates. Branch on the exit code and the numeric `status`.

### Internal

- `sn init` and `sn profile add` share one profile-writing core in `cli/profile.rs`
  (`resolve_name` → `resolve_input` → `save_and_verify`) and differ only in policy,
  so the two paths cannot drift. The authenticated-identity read is likewise shared
  (`auth::whoami`).

## 0.8.0 (2026-07-11)

An adversarial review of the docs — checked against the compiled CLI, ServiceNow's
official API docs, the published release assets, and a live instance — drove this
release: every documented claim is now either verified true or fixed, plus two
classes of code defects the review surfaced.

### Breaking changes

- **Every destructive `delete` now requires confirmation.** `change delete`,
  `change task delete`, `attachment delete`, and `cmdb relation delete` gain the
  guard `table delete` already had: a `[y/N]` prompt on a TTY, and a required
  `--yes`/`-y` when stdin is not a terminal (exit 1 with a usage error instead of
  deleting silently). Scripts calling these commands must add `--yes`.

### Added

- **Single-letter short flags** on the highest-traffic parameters: `-q`
  (`--query`), `-f` (`--fields`), `-D` (`--data`), `-F` (`--field`). Capitals
  mirror curl's `-d`/`-F` mnemonics; lowercase `-d` is the verbosity ladder and
  `-f` belongs to `--fields`.
- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — the repo is now its own Claude Code
  plugin marketplace, so the documented install flow works as written:
  `claude plugin marketplace add tehubersheezy/servicenow-cli`, then
  `claude plugin install sn`.

### Fixed

- **Verbose logging no longer leaks secrets.** `-ddd` printed OAuth
  token-endpoint responses — live access and refresh tokens — in cleartext;
  token values are now masked (metadata like `token_type` / `expires_in` stays
  readable). `-dd` masked only `Authorization`; it now also masks `Set-Cookie`
  session tokens, and the mask label no longer misstates the auth scheme on
  OAuth profiles.
- **Docs no longer claim PUT blanks omitted fields.** `replace` was documented
  as "full overwrite — omitted fields are blanked"; ServiceNow actually applies
  PUT as a partial update (verified against a live instance and the official
  Table API docs). The docs now say so and explain how to clear a field
  explicitly.
- **The `cmdb relation add` example payload was unusable** — bare
  `type`/`target` keys; the API requires them wrapped in
  `outbound_relations`/`inbound_relations`. Fixed in the README, agent guide,
  and both skills.
- **The documented Claude-plugin install command didn't exist**
  (`claude plugin install --dir`); replaced with the real marketplace flow.
- Documentation gaps closed: the stderr envelope's `sn_error` field, the global
  `--timeout`, the Parameters table's missing rows
  (`--suppress-pagination-header`, `--query-category`) and per-command
  `--setlimit` defaults, the `attachment download` `--output` file-path
  double-meaning, and the TOC's missing Shell completions entry.

## 0.7.1 (2026-07-08)

### Fixes

- **`updateset create` sent the wrong query parameter.** It posted `name=…`, but
  the CICD Update Set API's required parameter is `update_set_name` (verified
  against the official docs on the australia/zurich/yokohama families). ServiceNow
  ignores unknown query params, so the required name never arrived. The `--name`
  flag is unchanged (with `--update-set-name` as an alias); only the wire parameter
  was corrected.
- **`updateset retrieve` ignored its source selectors.** The flags sent
  `source_id` / `source_instance_id`, but the API expects `update_source_id` /
  `update_source_instance_id` — so the selectors were silently dropped and retrieve
  always fell back to ServiceNow's own source resolution. Flags renamed to
  `--update-source-id` / `--update-source-instance-id` and the wire parameters
  corrected. (These flags never functioned before, so nothing that worked breaks.)
- **`sn ping` now honors `--output table`.** It emitted JSON regardless of the
  output mode; its final emission routes through `write_response` like every other
  command, so `--output table`/`--pretty`/`--compact` all apply.

### Changed

- **`-v` prints the version** (with `-V` kept as an alias); the verbose logging
  ladder moves to **`-d` / `-dd` / `-ddd`** (long form `--verbose`). This reverses
  the 0.6.1 `-v`-is-verbose choice in favor of the more common version-on-`-v`
  convention.
- **`sn init --auth oauth` registers a public PKCE client by default** and no longer
  prompts for a client secret on the interactive authorization-code flow. Pass
  `--client-secret` explicitly for a confidential authorization-code client;
  `client_credentials` still requires one.

## 0.7.0 (2026-07-08)

A coherence pass on authentication and profile handling. A profile is now the
single unit of identity: commands either **manage** profiles (`sn init`,
`sn profile *`) or **use** exactly one (`--profile` > `default_profile`). Nothing
mixes stored profile state with per-invocation argv fragments anymore.

### Breaking changes

- **Removed the `--instance-override`, `--username`, and `--password` global
  flags.** They grafted argv fragments onto a stored profile's identity, producing
  chimeras — half from disk, half from the command line. On an OAuth profile,
  `--instance-override` redirected the token endpoint, sending the refresh token
  and client secret to an arbitrary host. Change identity by editing the profile
  (`sn init`) or selecting another (`--profile`).
- **Removed the phantom `"default"` profile fallback.** With no `--profile` and no
  `default_profile`, `sn` used to invent a profile named `"default"` that nobody
  created, surfacing errors about a phantom. It now fails fast: `no profile
  selected; pass --profile <name> or run \`sn init\``.
- **`sn auth login` is now a pure session command with no flags.** It previously
  doubled as a second, partial `sn init` — writing `client_id`/`grant`/
  `redirect_uri`, force-converting a profile to OAuth, and able to persist an empty
  instance while minting tokens against an `--instance-override` host. It now
  resolves the selected profile, requires `auth = "oauth"` with an `[oauth]` block
  (a basic profile errors with `does not use oauth; run \`sn init\``), runs the flow
  with the stored grant, and caches tokens. Configure OAuth via `sn init --auth
  oauth`.
- **Removed `sn auth test`.** Use `sn ping` — it verifies auth and adds latency and
  the ServiceNow build version.
- **Empty/whitespace `instance` is rejected** instead of silently producing a
  scheme-only `https://` base URL.

### Added

- **`SN_CONFIG_DIR`** — points directly at the directory holding `config.toml` and
  `credentials.toml` (no `sn` subdirectory appended), overriding the platform-native
  location on every OS. This is the cross-platform config-isolation mechanism,
  superseding the Linux-only `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` hack; config-dependent integration
  tests are no longer `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]`-gated.
- **Richer `sn profile list` / `sn profile show`.** `list` reports each profile's
  `auth` method and a `default` marker; `show` surfaces the auth method and, for
  OAuth profiles, the client_id, grant, redirect_uri, pkce, and token state
  (`loggedIn`/`hasRefreshToken`/`expiresAt`) with all secret material redacted.

### Changed

- **`sn auth login` / `logout` / `refresh` now emit success JSON to stdout**
  (joining `status`), honoring the machine contract; all four also honor
  `--output`/`--pretty`/`--compact`.
- **Re-running `sn init` over an existing profile is non-destructive** — it merges
  onto the stored profile, clears only the secrets of the auth method being switched
  away from, and preserves `proxy_username`/`proxy_password`.

### Migration

| Old | New |
|---|---|
| `sn --instance-override URL --username U --password P table list …` | `sn init` a profile once, then `sn --profile NAME table list …` |
| `sn auth login --client-id … --grant … --instance …` | `sn init --auth oauth …`, then `sn auth login` |
| `sn auth test` | `sn ping` |
| relying on the implicit `"default"` profile | `sn profile use NAME` (sets `default_profile`) or pass `--profile` |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (Linux-only) for config isolation | `SN_CONFIG_DIR` (all platforms) |

## 0.6.1 (2026-07-04)

### Fixes

- **Exit-code contract at the CLI edge.** Clap parse errors (unknown flags,
  missing args) are now intercepted via `try_parse` so usage mistakes exit `1`
  — clap's default `2` is reserved for API errors — and emit the JSON error
  envelope on stderr when stderr is piped. `--help`/`--version` still exit `0`.
- **`-v` is now `--verbose`** (as the help text always claimed); `--version`
  moves to `-V` per clap convention.
- **`import bulk`** accepts the README-documented bare JSON array and wraps it
  as `{"records": [...]}` for `insertMultiple`; pre-wrapped objects still pass
  through unchanged.
- **`introspect`** builds the clap command before describing it, so boolean
  flags no longer report `takes_value: true` with `["true","false"]` (which led
  agents to emit `--all true`); adds `positional`, `repeatable`, and
  `default_values` fields.
- **`--wait-timeout <SECS>`** now bounds the CICD poll loop (exit `3` on
  expiry); all eight async CICD call sites route their final emission through a
  shared `finish_cicd`, so `--output table` works under `--wait`.
- **`-vvv` body logging** truncates on a char boundary instead of panicking
  mid-UTF-8 sequence.

### OAuth

- `sn init`'s OAuth branch prompts for the client secret immediately after the
  client id, and skips the redirect-URI prompt under `client_credentials`.
- **OAuth scope removed entirely** (flag, config field, request parameter).
  ServiceNow grants scopes through the Application Registry entry an admin
  configures, so a client-requested scope granted nothing and only invited
  misconfiguration. Existing `config.toml` files with a leftover `scope=` line
  still parse (serde ignores unknown keys).

### Dependencies

- Bump `quinn-proto` to 0.11.15 (RUSTSEC-2026-0185).

### CI

- The security workflow's `cargo audit` job now installs a prebuilt cargo-audit
  binary (via `taiki-e/install-action`) instead of compiling it from source,
  which had been failing intermittently on crates.io index fetches.

### Docs

- README gains a table of contents, an at-a-glance command block, and an
  OAuth / SSO setup section documenting `sn auth login/status/refresh/logout`.

## 0.6.0 (2026-06-16)

### OAuth 2.0 / SSO authentication

- Profiles can now authenticate via OAuth 2.0 (`auth = "oauth"`) in addition to
  HTTP Basic — the supported path for instances fronted by external SSO
  (Okta/Azure AD/ADFS), where a human's password lives in the IdP and Basic auth
  cannot work.
- Two grants:
  - **`authorization_code`** — interactive browser flow with a loopback redirect
    server (RFC 8252) and PKCE S256 by default. The redirect URI defaults to
    `http://localhost:8400/callback` and must be registered exactly in
    ServiceNow's Application Registry.
  - **`client_credentials`** — non-interactive service-to-service tokens.
- New commands:
  - **`sn auth login`** — configure OAuth, run the flow, cache tokens, and verify
    (`--client-id`, `--client-secret`, `--redirect-uri`, `--scope`, `--grant`,
    `--no-pkce`, `--instance`).
  - **`sn auth status`** — show the resolved auth method and token expiry.
  - **`sn auth refresh`** — force a token refresh now.
  - **`sn auth logout`** — discard cached tokens.
- **`sn init`** now offers `basic` or `oauth` setup interactively (and via the
  same flags), so a profile can be stood up end to end in one command.
- Tokens are refreshed (or minted, for client-credentials) transparently before
  every request; new tokens are persisted automatically. Non-secret OAuth config
  lives in `config.toml`; the client secret and tokens live in
  `credentials.toml` (chmod 0600 on Unix).

Backward compatible: existing `config.toml` files without an `auth` field
continue to behave as `basic` profiles.

## 0.4.1 (2026-04-25)

### Fixes

- **Release pipeline** (v0.4.0 was tagged but never published).
  - `wix/main.wxs` was regenerated after the repo rename so the MSI's
    `ARPHELPLINK` ("More info") points at the new
    `tehubersheezy/servicenow-cli` URL. `dist plan` rejected v0.4.0 because
    the WXS template hadn't been refreshed alongside `Cargo.toml`'s
    `homepage` field.
  - ARM64 Windows builds now run on a native Windows runner
    (`windows-latest`) via `[dist.github-custom-runners]`. The default
    Linux runner couldn't cross-compile `ring` because its build script
    emits MSVC `/imsvc` flags that clang on Linux rejects.

## 0.4.0 (2026-04-25)

### New commands

- **`sn user me`** — returns the currently authenticated user's record. Resolves
  the identity via `gs.getUserName()`, so it works regardless of auth method
  (basic auth, OAuth, etc.).
- **`sn ping`** — one-shot health check. Returns auth status, instance URL,
  username, end-to-end latency in ms, and the ServiceNow build name/tag if
  reachable. Useful as the first thing to run when something breaks.
- **`sn open <table> <sys_id>`** — opens the ServiceNow web UI form for a record
  in the default browser via `nav_to.do?uri=...`. Pass `--print-url` to print
  the URL to stdout instead of launching a browser.
- **`sn raw <method> <path>`** — generic REST passthrough for endpoints that
  aren't yet modeled as typed commands. Accepts arbitrary methods (case
  insensitive), `--query key=value` (repeatable), and the same `--data` /
  `--field` body sources as the typed commands. Response is emitted exactly as
  ServiceNow returns it (no envelope unwrapping). The escape hatch for the long
  tail of ServiceNow's API surface.
- **`sn completion <shell>`** — generate tab-completion scripts for `bash`,
  `zsh`, `fish`, `powershell`, and `elvish` via `clap_complete`.

### New output mode

- **`--output table`** — render JSON results as a human-readable columnar table
  using `comfy-table`. Suitable for interactive browsing; for scripts and
  pipelines, leave the default JSON output. Single objects render as a
  two-column key/value table; arrays of objects render as a wide table with the
  union of keys as headers; empty arrays render as `(no records)`.

### Internal

- New shared helper `cli::table::write_response(global, value)` centralizes
  output dispatch so each command's emit site is a one-liner. All read/write
  command call sites now route through it instead of constructing
  `emit_value(...)` chains.
- Six new modules: `src/cli/{user,ping,open_record,raw,completion}.rs` and
  `src/output_table.rs`.
- New deps: `clap_complete = "4"`, `webbrowser = "1"`, `comfy-table = "7"`.

## 0.3.3 (2026-04-25)

### Distribution

- **Windows MSI installers.** The release pipeline now builds signed-ready
  `.msi` installers for both x86_64 and ARM64 Windows
  (`sn-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.msi`, `sn-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.msi`).
  Suitable for unattended deployment via SCCM/Intune/Group Policy:
  `msiexec /i sn-...msi /qn`.
- **ARM64 Windows binary.** Native build for Surface Pro X and Copilot+ PCs
  (`sn-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.zip`), avoiding x86 emulation overhead.

### Internal

- Added `authors` field and `[package.metadata.wix]` GUIDs to `Cargo.toml`
  (required for stable MSI upgrade behavior across releases).
- Added `wix/main.wxs` (cargo-wix's MSI definition template, generated by
  `dist init`).

## 0.3.2 (2026-04-25)

### Distribution

- **Homebrew tap.** `sn` is now installable via Homebrew:

  ```bash
  brew install tehubersheezy/sn/sn
  ```

  The release workflow auto-publishes the cargo-dist-generated formula
  to [tehubersheezy/homebrew-sn](https://github.com/tehubersheezy/homebrew-sn)
  on every tagged release.

## 0.3.1 (2026-04-24)

### Documentation

- All write subcommands (`table`, `cmdb`, `catalog`, `change`, `import`,
  `identify`) now show consistent `--data` and `--field` help text covering
  the `@file` and `@-` (stdin) idioms. The binary always supported these,
  but only `sn table create` documented them — every other write command
  was mute, leading users to invent shell-quoting workarounds for
  multi-line content.
- `sn --help` now ends with a `BODY INPUT` reference and three concrete
  examples covering multi-line file bodies, file-backed field values
  (`--field description=@notes.md`), and stdin-piped input
  (`jq … | sn … --data @-`).

### Tests

- Added integration tests pinning `sn table update --data @file.json` and
  `sn table update --field name=@file.txt` so the multi-line write paths
  stay regression-tested.

## 0.3.0 (2026-04-23)

### Breaking

- `-v` is now the short flag for `--version` (was `--verbose`). Use `--verbose`
  (or `-vv`, `-vvv`) for verbosity levels. Scripts relying on `sn -v <cmd>` for
  verbose output must switch to `sn --verbose <cmd>`.

### Improvements

- **Observability is live.** `--verbose` logs `METHOD url` + elapsed ms to
  stderr. `-vv` adds response headers. `-vvv` adds request/response bodies
  (truncated). The logger functions existed previously but were never wired in.
- **HTTP error bodies no longer disappear.** Non-JSON 5xx responses (proxy
  errors, WAF blocks, upstream HTML) now surface the first 500 chars of the
  body as `detail` in the error envelope instead of collapsing to `HTTP 502`.
- **Broken-pipe handling.** `sn … | head` exits 0 silently instead of exit 1
  with a `{"error": {"message": "stdout: ..."}}` envelope on stderr.
- **`sn init` respects global proxy/TLS flags.** `sn init --proxy … --insecure
  --ca-cert …` now uses those settings for credential verification *and*
  persists them to the saved profile so future invocations pick them up.

### Internal

- Single `Client::request` method replaces four near-duplicate HTTP verb
  methods.
- Per-command arg structs (`*Args`, `*Sub`) now live alongside their handler
  modules; `cli/mod.rs` is a ~240-line entry point + re-exports (was 1,477).
- Unused `url` crate dependency removed.

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-22)

Initial release.
