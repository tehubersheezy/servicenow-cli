//! `sn watch` — live record watchers over ServiceNow's AMB websocket.
//!
//! The protocol itself lives in [`crate::amb`]. This module is the policy layer:
//! it turns the arguments into a channel, supervises the socket (reconnect with
//! backoff), enforces the termination limits that make an infinite stream usable
//! from a script, and filters events.
//!
//! ## What an event carries
//!
//! An AMB event carries values. Its `record` holds every field named in `changes`
//! — with the new value, as a `{display_value, value}` pair — plus five `sys_*`
//! audit columns (`sys_created_by/on`, `sys_updated_by/on`, `sys_mod_count`). On
//! an insert that is the whole populated row, since `changes` then lists every
//! field. This is what the stream emits, unchanged.
//!
//! What an event does *not* carry is any field that did not change. A watch on
//! `state` that also wants `number` or `assigned_to` gets neither, because they
//! were not written — read them explicitly (`sn table get <table> <sys_id>
//! --fields …`), which keeps the extra API call and its timing visible at the
//! call site. A `--hydrate` flag used to hide that read behind the stream (one
//! Table API GET per event, *replacing* `record` with the whole row); it was
//! removed in 0.13.0 because it traded a correct answer for a wrong one — a
//! fetched row is the row as of the fetch, so a record written twice in quick
//! succession hydrated the first event with the second write's values, and
//! nothing said so. The flag itself was a survivor of the pre-0.10.0 false
//! premise that events carry only `sys_*` columns (hydration was the *default*
//! until checking the wire disproved that).
//!
//! ## Why filtering is client-side
//!
//! An AMB channel is defined solely by table + encoded query: it delivers every
//! insert, update and delete touching a matching record, and there is no way to
//! ask the server for a subset. `--operation` and `--on-change` therefore filter
//! here, before hydration, so an unwanted event costs nothing.
//!
//! ## Gaps: the stream is best-effort, and says where it broke
//!
//! AMB has no replay and no cursor. A subscription starts at "now", so every
//! change that happened while a session was down is simply gone — no later
//! message carries it, and a reconnect cannot ask for it. A watch is therefore a
//! best-effort feed, not a log; anything that must be complete has to be
//! reconciled against the table itself over the outage window.
//!
//! The routine threat — the instance reaping a watcher's HTTP session ~60–120s
//! after it was minted (measured live; neither AMB traffic nor HTTP touches
//! prevent it) — does not produce drops at all: [`pump_rotating`] replaces the
//! session on a schedule (`--session-rotate`, default 45s, under the measured
//! floor) with an overlapped handoff that opens no gap and writes no marker.
//! A marker therefore reports a *genuine* failure: a network drop, or a
//! rotation that lost its race to the reaper. That fallback is
//! [`crate::amb::Amb::poll`] surfacing the session's death the moment a connect
//! reply reports it — the alternative was a watcher that kept polling the dead
//! session and silently delivered nothing forever.
//!
//! What the watcher can do honestly is say *where* the hole is. On a successful
//! resubscribe after a drop it writes one synthetic line:
//!
//! ```text
//! {"sn_watch":"reconnected","downtime_ms":4100,"attempt":2}
//! ```
//!
//! Everything between the preceding line and that marker is missing. Without it
//! a consumer cannot tell a quiet table from a lost one, which is the failure
//! this shape exists to prevent — see [`gap_marker`] for why it is keyed rather
//! than shaped like an event, and [`Stream`] for why it is not counted as one.
//!
//! ## What `--idle-timeout` measures
//!
//! Subscribed time, and only subscribed time. The question the flag asks is
//! "has anything happened for N seconds?", and while the watcher is opening its
//! first socket or reconnecting after a drop it has no way to know — nothing
//! could reach it either way. So every interval spent off the channel is
//! forgiven ([`Stream::resume`]): the clock is started by the first successful
//! subscribe, not by the process, and an outage is added back rather than
//! counted. The marker's `downtime_ms` is exactly the interval that was
//! forgiven.
//!
//! The alternative — wall-clock time since the last event — made two silent
//! wrong answers, both of them exit 0 with a stream that looks merely quiet: an
//! instance slower to mint a session than the timeout never reached its first
//! poll, and any outage longer than the timeout (guaranteed once backoff caps
//! at 60s) made the marker the last line of the stream, so the hole it had just
//! announced was never covered. What forgiving does *not* do is restart the
//! clock per session, which would let a socket flapping faster than the timeout
//! hold a watcher open forever: silence accumulates across sessions.
