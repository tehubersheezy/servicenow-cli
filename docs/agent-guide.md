# `sn` agent usage guide

One-time read for an LLM agent that reads, creates, updates, and deletes
ServiceNow records via `sn`. Assume zero prior ServiceNow knowledge — every
operation below is runnable from a cold start after `sn init`.

`sn` is a Rust CLI wrapping ServiceNow's REST APIs: Table, Change Management,
Attachment, CMDB (Instance + Meta), Import Set, Service Catalog, Identification
& Reconciliation, CICD (App Repository, Update Sets, ATF), Aggregate,
Performance Analytics, two schema-discovery endpoints, and the REST API
Explorer's catalogue (`sn api`). It emits JSON on stdout, structured JSON errors
on stderr, and stable exit codes.

## Output, errors & exit codes (read first)

**stdout is always JSON** — pretty-printed on a TTY, compact when piped. The
default shape is **unwrapped**: `sn` strips ServiceNow's `{"result": ...}`
envelope. `list` and `schema` commands return an array; `get`/`create`/`update`
return one record object.

Three output modes via `--output`:
- `default` — unwrapped JSON (above).
- `raw` — preserves the full `{"result": ...}` envelope.
- `table` — columnar text table for humans (don't parse it).

```bash
sn table get incident abc123 --output raw
# {"result":{"sys_id":"abc123","number":"INC0010001","short_description":"Mail server down"}}
```

Non-obvious shapes worth knowing:

| Command | stdout |
|---|---|
| `table delete`, `change delete`, `attachment delete` | empty (exit code signals success) |
| `profile use` | `{"ok":true,"profile":"ci","default":true}` |
| `profile remove` | `{"ok":true,"profile":"ci","removed":true,"wasDefault":false}` — `removed:false` (still exit 0) when there was no such profile, so removal is idempotent |
| `init` | empty stdout — it reports to a **human on stderr**. Use `profile add` if you need JSON. |
| `attachment download` | raw bytes, or `{"path","size"}` with `--out <file>` |
| `aggregate` | `{"stats":{...}}` — but with `--group-by`, an **array** of `{groupby_fields,stats}` |
| `app` / `updateset` / `atf run` | progress object with `status_label` + `links.progress.id` |
| `progress` | `{status_label, percent_complete, status_message}` |
| `scores unfavorite` | the endpoint's body, or `{"ok":true,"uuid":"..."}` when there is none — it emitted nothing at all before. `scores favorite` passes its body through unchanged, which is `null` where the instance answers with no content |
| `ping` | see [`sn ping`](#sn-ping) — 14 keys, and `username` is the *instance's* answer |

**stderr is always a JSON error object on any non-zero exit:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Record not found",
    "detail": "No record with sys_id 'abc123' in table 'incident'",
    "status_code": 404,
    "transaction_id": "3f4ab12c8d0001",
    "sn_error": {"message": "No Record found", "detail": "ACL restricts the record retrieval"}
  }
}
```

`sn_error` is ServiceNow's original payload verbatim (null for transport/CLI
errors — check `.error.message` first). `transaction_id` is SN's correlation id,
useful for support requests.

**Every key but `message` may be absent**, and `status_code` in particular. Two
paths omit it because the failure carried no HTTP status at all: a CICD
operation the instance reported as failed *inside* a 200 under `--wait`, and a
read whose scripted query the instance silently dropped (`sn user me`). It is
never `0` — no HTTP response carries that — so a `jq` test has to tolerate a
missing key (`jq -r '.error.status_code'` prints `null`, which no comparison
against a status will match).

`status_code: 200` is a *different* thing and does occur: `sn graphql`, `sn gr`,
`sn journal`, `sn playbook` and `sn variables set` detect failures ServiceNow reports in-band,
inside a genuinely successful HTTP 200, and they report that 200 truthfully
rather than hiding it. So `status_code` answers "what did HTTP say", not "did
this succeed" — **branch on the exit code, and treat `status_code` as
diagnostic detail.**

**Exit codes — branch on these before parsing stdout:**

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Usage / config / parse error (bad flags, unreadable file, malformed JSON, mixing `--data` + `--field`, bad proxy URL / CA file) |
| 2 | API error — ServiceNow 4xx/5xx other than auth (400 bad table, 404 not-found, 429 rate-limit, 5xx), or a failure the instance reported inside an HTTP 200 (`status_code` is then either `200` or absent — see above; do not branch on it) |
| 3 | Network / transport (DNS, connection refused, timeout, TLS handshake, proxy unreachable) |
| 4 | Auth — **every** 401 and **every** 403 |

**Exit 4 is not only "the password is wrong."** `sn` maps 401 and 403 alike to
exit 4, so a row-level ACL denial, a field the profile's role may not write, and
an expired token all arrive the same way — with `status_code` telling you which
status it was and nothing telling you which cause. There is no exit 2 with
`status_code: 403`; that shape cannot occur. So do not wire exit 4 straight to
"re-login": re-authenticate at most once, and if the same call fails again the
answer is a role or an ACL, not a credential.

```bash
out=$(sn table get incident "$sysid" 2>/tmp/sn.err)
case $? in
  0) jq -r '.short_description' <<<"$out" ;;
  2) [ "$(jq -r '.error.status_code // empty' /tmp/sn.err)" = 404 ] && exit 0  # not found — nothing to do
     jq -r '.error.message' /tmp/sn.err >&2; exit 1 ;;                        # status_code may be absent
  3) echo "transport failure — check connectivity" >&2; exit 1 ;;
  4) if [ "$(jq -r '.error.status_code' /tmp/sn.err)" = 403 ]; then
       echo "authenticated, but forbidden — the role/ACL, not the password" >&2
     else
       echo "auth failed — OAuth: 'sn profile login'; basic: re-add the profile" >&2
     fi; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

`sn ping` reports the identity and privileges the *instance* attributes to the
credentials, which is the cheapest way to tell a dead credential from a live one
that simply lacks the role.

**Verbose debugging** (stderr only; never required to parse output):

| Flag | Adds to stderr |
|---|---|
| `-d` | method, URL, status, elapsed per request |
| `-dd` | + response headers |
| `-ddd` | + request/response bodies (Authorization/Set-Cookie headers and OAuth token values masked to `****`) |

Turn on `-d` after an exit 2/3 to see the exact URL built — a sysparm typo
producing a malformed path is a common 404 cause. Verbose text is free-form and
may change between versions; only the stderr error object is structured.

## Setup & profiles

```bash
sn init                    # interactive wizard: prompts, then claims default_profile
sn profile add prod ...    # scriptable: adds a profile, leaves default_profile alone
sn profile list            # also: show <name> / use <name> / remove <name>
sn ping                    # verify auth + latency + build version (the health check)
```

**`sn profile add` is the one to reach for.** It is the agent-safe half of the pair:
it emits JSON on stdout, and it **never prompts when stdin is not a terminal** — a
missing field is exit 1 naming the flag, not a blocked read. `sn init` is a human
wizard that also takes over `default_profile`, which is rarely what you want when
adding an instance to an existing setup.

```bash
sn profile add ci --instance dev12345 --username svc --password-stdin < secret.txt
# → {"auth":"basic","default":false,"instance":"dev12345.service-now.com","next":"sn profile use ci",
#    "ok":true,"profile":"ci","user":"svc","verified":true}
```

Keys come back sorted. `"next"` appears only when it has something to tell you — here, that no
default profile is selected yet, so this one needs `sn profile use ci` or an explicit `--profile ci`.

Pipe secrets in rather than passing `--password` / `--client-secret`, which any
process can read out of `ps` and which land in shell history.

`add` always checks the credentials against the instance, and **a profile that
fails the check is not written at all** — you never inherit a half-configured
identity that breaks somewhere confusing later. Its contract:

| situation | exit | effect |
|---|---|---|
| ok | 0 | profile written, `"verified":true` |
| profile already exists | 1 | nothing written — pass `--force` |
| required flag missing (no TTY) | 1 | nothing written — message names the flag |
| credentials rejected | 4 | **nothing written** |
| `--no-verify` | 0 | written unverified, no network call |

`--set-default` also makes it the default; otherwise use `sn profile use <name>`,
or pass `--profile <name>` per command. When no default profile exists, `add` says
so in a `"next"` field.

Secrets go to `credentials.toml` (chmod 600 on Unix; the per-user `%APPDATA%` ACL
on Windows) and non-secret config to `config.toml`, under `~/.config/sn/` (Linux),
`~/Library/Application Support/sn/` (macOS), or `%APPDATA%\sn\` (Windows).
`SN_CONFIG_DIR` relocates that directory (used as-is — no `sn` subdir appended);
it's the supported way to sandbox `sn` for CI or ephemeral sessions:

```bash
SN_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/sn-sandbox sn profile add ci --instance dev12345 \
  --username svc --password-stdin < secret.txt
SN_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/sn-sandbox sn --profile ci table list incident --limit 1
```

**API key.** `sn profile add --auth apikey --api-key-stdin < key.txt` works headlessly:
the stored key goes out as the `x-sn-apikey` header on every request and is verified
against the instance before the profile is saved, like any other credential.

**OAuth.** `sn profile add --auth oauth --grant client_credentials` works headlessly
(the token is minted and verified). The default `authorization_code` grant needs a
browser, so there is nothing an agent can verify: `add` refuses on a non-TTY rather
than save an untested profile. Register it with `--no-verify` and have a human run
`sn profile login --profile <name>`. Session state is `sn profile status` / `refresh` /
`logout`; tokens then refresh transparently on every command.

**Profile selection** (highest precedence first): `--profile <name>` →
`default_profile` in `config.toml` → error (`no profile selected`, exit 1). There
is no implicit fallback.

`-p` is a short alias for `--profile`. Both are global, so either may appear
before or after the subcommand:

```bash
sn --profile prod table list incident --limit 5
sn table list incident --limit 5 -p prod          # identical
```

A profile is the single unit of identity — instance URL + credentials together.
There is no way to graft a one-off instance/username/password onto a command,
and there are no env vars for credentials or profile selection: configure a
profile with `sn profile add` (or `sn init`). Only proxy/TLS and the config *directory* are
env-overridable (precedence: CLI flag > env var > per-profile config field):

| CLI flag | Env var | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `--proxy <URL>` | `SN_PROXY` | HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS5 proxy |
| `--no-proxy` | `SN_NO_PROXY` | bypass proxy (env is comma-separated hosts) |
| `--insecure` | `SN_INSECURE=1` | skip TLS cert verification (off by default) |
| `--ca-cert <PATH>` | `SN_CA_CERT` | custom CA for the instance |
| `--proxy-ca-cert <PATH>` | `SN_PROXY_CA_CERT` | custom CA for the proxy |

Proxy auth and the same settings can also live per-profile in the config files
(`proxy`, `no_proxy`, `insecure`, `ca_cert`, `proxy_ca_cert`, `proxy_username`,
`proxy_password`).

Config and credentials are written atomically — into a same-directory temp file
created `0600` by `open(2)` and renamed over the target — under an advisory lock
on a `.sn.lock` sidecar in the same directory. Both files are `0600`
(`config.toml` was `0644` in earlier releases; the rename repairs it in place). Two
consequences for an agent: parallel invocations that write profiles or refresh
OAuth tokens serialize instead of losing each other's work, and a writer that
cannot take the lock within 10s exits **1** rather than hanging forever.

### `sn ping`

The health check, and the cheapest answer to "who does the instance think I am?"
— one request that proves the credentials authenticate *and* names the caller,
plus a second for the build version.

```bash
sn ping
# {"ok":true,"profile":"prod","instance":"acme.service-now.com",
#  "username":"admin","identity_source":"sg/impersonation/session",
#  "user_sys_id":null,"user_display_name":null,"admin":true,"can_impersonate":true,
#  "impersonating":false,"original_user":"admin",
#  "latency_ms":195,"build_name":null,"build_tag":null}
```

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `ok` | always `true` — a failed ping is a nonzero exit with the error envelope, not `ok:false` |
| `username` | **the identity the instance asserts**, not the configured one. They disagree exactly when the profile is wrong, and echoing the config back verifies nothing |
| `identity_source` | which endpoint named the caller: `sg/impersonation/session`, `ui/user/current_user`, `sys_user`, or `profile` — the last meaning no endpoint answered and this is the configured name |
| `admin` / `can_impersonate` | privileges as the instance reports them; `null` when the endpoint that carries them was absent |
| `impersonating` / `original_user` | whether this session is an impersonation, and who started it. `impersonating` is `true` only when two present, non-blank names differ; `null` means unknown |
| `user_sys_id` / `user_display_name` | the caller's record, when the answering endpoint identified it (`null` otherwise) |
| `build_name` / `build_tag` | instance build, from a `sys_properties` read of `glide.buildname`/`glide.buildtag`; `null` when that read returns nothing — a Zurich PDI publishes neither, so null here is not a failure |
| `profile` / `instance` / `latency_ms` | which profile was used, its host, and the round trip in ms |

**Never derive identity from `sn table list sys_user --limit 1`.** A bare limited
read of `sys_user` returns whichever row sorts first — a stranger, reported with
full confidence. `sn ping` and `sn user me` both ask endpoints that name the
caller directly (`sn user me` resolves the caller's sys_id, then reads that one
record), and both refuse to answer rather than hand back an arbitrary row.

## Discovery flow

When you don't know a table's schema, discover it before writing.

```bash
sn schema tables --filter incident        # fuzzy match name or label
```
```json
[{"value":"incident","label":"Incident","rawLabel":"Incident","reference":false,"sequence":-1,
  "image":"","missing":false,"selected":false,"used":false}]
```

⚠️ **The table name is `value`, not `name`.** This endpoint returns a picker-style
list, so `jq -r '.[].name'` yields `null` for every row. Use `jq -r '.[].value'`.
There is no `super_class`, `is_extendable`, or `sys_id` here.

```bash
sn schema columns incident --writable      # mandatory fields, types, references
```
```json
[
  {"name":"short_description","type":"string","internal_type":"string","max_length":160,
   "mandatory":true,"read_only":false,"default":"","label":"Short description"},
  {"name":"caller_id","type":"reference","mandatory":false,"reference":"sys_user",
   "reference_display_field":"name","label":"Caller"},
  {"name":"state","type":"choice","internal_type":"integer","mandatory":true,"default":"1",
   "choice_type":"dropdown","choices":[{"value":"1","label":"New"},{"value":"2","label":"In Progress"}]}
]
```

⚠️ There is **no `choice_field`** and **no `default_value`**. The default is `default`.
A choice column is one whose **`type` is `"choice"`** — note its `internal_type` may
still be `"integer"` — and its options are inlined in a **`choices[]`** array, so you
often don't need a second `schema choices` call. `reference` is *absent* on
non-reference columns rather than `null`.

`columns` filters: `--writable` (excludes read-only), `--mandatory`,
`--filter <substr>` (name or label), `--references-only`, `--choices-only`,
`--type <type>` (e.g. `string`, `integer`, `reference`).

```bash
sn schema choices incident state           # valid values for a choice field
```
```json
[{"value":"1","label":"New"},{"value":"2","label":"In Progress"},{"value":"6","label":"Resolved"},{"value":"7","label":"Closed"}]
```

The numeric `value` is what you send to write APIs; the `label` is what
`--display-value true` returns on reads. Now write with confidence:

```bash
sn table create incident --field short_description="server down" --field state=2 --field priority=1
```

(Example values throughout are illustrative; real values depend on your instance.)

### Finding an API (`sn api`)

`sn schema` describes tables; `sn api` describes *endpoints*, from the same
catalogue the REST API Explorer reads. Use it before assuming an operation has
no API — the answer for anything `sn` doesn't model is usually `sn raw` against
a route this command will name for you.

```bash
sn api list                       # every namespace, with API and endpoint counts
sn api list -n sn_chg_rest        # the APIs in one namespace
sn api search attachment          # endpoints matching a substring, with method + route
sn api search cart -n sn_sc -m POST
sn api spec "Table API"           # the OpenAPI 3 document
sn api spec "Table API" --format yaml > table-api.yaml
```

```json
[{"api_name":"now/attachment","description":"Delete an attachment","method":"DELETE",
  "name":"Attachment API","namespace":"now","route":"/now/attachment/{sys_id}","version":"latest"}]
```

`search` matches case-insensitively across namespace, API name, route and both
descriptions; a row carries everything `sn raw` needs (`route` is relative to
`/api`, so `/now/attachment/{sys_id}` is `sn raw DELETE
/api/now/attachment/<id>`). `list` and `search` summarize — `--output raw`
prints the catalogue endpoint's own response instead, several hundred KB of it,
for piping to `jq`.

`spec` takes the name `list` reports, case-insensitively; a unique substring is
enough. An ambiguous one is exit 1 listing the candidates and the namespaces
they live in — narrow with `--namespace`, since an *exact* tie only ever spans
namespaces. `--format yaml` is written to stdout verbatim and ignores
`--pretty`/`--compact`/`--output`.

An unknown `--namespace` is exit 1 naming the near miss, not an empty result:
the catalogue answers a bad namespace with `{"result":{}}` and HTTP 200, which
would otherwise be indistinguishable from "no matches". A genuine 404 from the
spec endpoint is passed through with the instance's own explanation in `detail`
(it names a bad API or version precisely); only the doc family's own absence is
reported as "this release may not have it".

## Reading records (`list`, `get`)

```bash
# List with a cap, filter, and column projection
sn table list incident --query "active=true^priority=1" --fields "number,short_description,state" --setlimit 10
```
```json
[{"number":"INC0010001","short_description":"Mail server down","state":"In Progress"}]
```

`state` reads as a label, not `"2"`, because `--display-value` defaults to
`true` — see [Display values](#display-values) before you feed any of it back.

`--limit` aliases `--setlimit` (SN's `sysparm_limit`); the default is 1000 per
page on `table list`, `change list`, and `cmdb list`, and 100 on `change task
list`, `attachment list`, `catalog categories`, and `catalog items`. Drop it low
(`--setlimit 5`) for exploration.

```bash
# Get one record by sys_id (get takes a sys_id only — no --query)
sn table get incident a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

To find one record by criteria, use `list --limit 1 --query "..."` and read `[0]`.

**The read verb may be omitted on `table` and `cmdb`.** Both map to a REST path
that is already `{noun}/{id}`, so for a read the verb is implied by whether you
supplied an id:

```bash
sn table incident a1b2c3d4e5f6      # = sn table get incident a1b2c3d4e5f6
sn table incident                   # = sn table list incident
sn cmdb cmdb_ci_server ci001        # = sn cmdb get cmdb_ci_server ci001
```

Only `get` and `list` are ever inferred — **never a write** — and the choice is
decided rather than guessed: `get` requires a second positional and `list`
rejects one, so at most one of them can parse any given argv. A *near-miss* of a
real verb stays a typo: `sn table lst incident` returns
`tip: a similar subcommand exists: 'list'` rather than reading a table named
`lst`.

**The flip side, worth knowing when debugging:** a first token that is *not*
close to any real verb is taken as a table name, because that is exactly what
the shorthand is for. So `sn table bogus-verb incident` is not a usage error —
it reads a table called `bogus-verb` and fails with ServiceNow's
table-not-found (exit **2**), not `unrecognized subcommand` (exit 1). If you
get an unexpected "invalid table" on `table` or `cmdb`, check whether you
misspelled the *verb*.

Groups whose first token isn't reliably a noun (`change`, `catalog`) are
excluded from the shorthand, and an unrecognized subcommand there lists the
valid ones:

```
$ sn change sc_cat_item abc
error: unrecognized subcommand 'sc_cat_item'
  `sn change` subcommands: list, get, create, update, delete, nextstates,
  approvals, risk, schedule, task, ci, conflict, models, templates
```

### Display values

**`--display-value` defaults to `true`.** Reads come back as readable labels —
`state` is `"In Progress"`, not `"2"`; `assigned_to` is `"Abel Tuter"`, not a
sys_id. This changed in 0.11.0; before that the default was `false`.

| Value | Effect | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `true` (default) | display labels | reading, reporting, showing a human |
| `false` | raw values and sys_ids | feeding a value back into a query or a write |
| `all` | both — each field becomes `{"value","display_value"}` | you need to show one and send the other |

```bash
sn table get incident a1b2c3d4e5f6 --display-value all
# ... "state":{"value":"2","display_value":"In Progress"}, "priority":{"value":"1","display_value":"1 - Critical"}
```

**Two consequences that will bite a script.** Dates are also rewritten, into the
calling user's timezone and locale — `2026-08-04 14:22:01` comes back as
`08/04/2026 10:22:01 AM`, which **will not parse back into an encoded query**.
And a reference field yields a name where you needed the sys_id to chain into
the next call.

So: **anything you intend to send back to ServiceNow must be read with
`--display-value false`** (or `all`, reading the `value` side). Never echo a
`display_value` into an update or a `--query`.

```bash
sn table get incident a1b2c3d4e5f6 --display-value false     # raw, round-trippable
sn table list incident --query "sys_created_on>2026-08-01" --display-value false --fields sys_id
```

The default applies to `table`, `change`, `aggregate`, and `scores`. `sn watch`
has no such flag — an event's `record` already carries each field as a
`{display_value, value}` pair.

### Pagination & bulk processing

ServiceNow caps any single response. `--all` follows the `Link: rel="next"`
header and streams **every** matching record as JSONL — one object per line, so
you can pipe to `jq -c` without buffering the whole set:

```bash
sn table list incident --query "active=true" --all
sn table list incident --query "active=true" --all --array            # one JSON array instead (buffers in memory)
sn table list incident --query "active=true" --all --max-records 1000 # safety cap
sn table list incident --query "active=true" --all --setlimit 5000    # larger per-call batches
```

`--setlimit` is the per-API-call batch size under `--all`; `--offset` is ignored
in `--all` mode. Don't compute offsets by hand. For a single manual page, use
`--setlimit`+`--offset` without `--all`.

**`--all` refuses `--output raw` and `--output table`** (exit 1, before any
request goes out). Both were accepted and ignored in earlier releases, which is
worse: you got JSONL either way and nothing said so. `table` cannot size a column
without seeing every row — add `--array`, which buffers and renders. `raw` has
no fix: the paginator flattens each page's envelope into one record stream, so
there is no envelope left to keep, `--array` included. Page manually with
`--setlimit`/`--offset` if you need the envelope. Processing JSONL:

```bash
sn table list incident --query "active=true^priority=1" --all | jq -r '.number'           # extract a field
sn table list incident --all | jq -c 'select(.short_description|test("mail";"i"))'         # client-side filter
sn table list incident --all | jq -s 'group_by(.state)|map({state:.[0].state,count:length})' # group + count
sn table list incident --query "state=6^ORstate=7" --all | jq -r '.sys_id' \
  | while read -r sid; do sn table update incident "$sid" --field active=false; done        # stream into updates
```

### Encoded query syntax

`--query` takes a ServiceNow "encoded query." Build incrementally — run with
`--limit 1` first to sanity-check syntax, then widen.

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `=` / `!=` | equals / not equals | `state=2`, `state!=7` |
| `>` `>=` `<` `<=` | numeric/date compare | `priority<=2` |
| `LIKE` / `STARTSWITH` / `ENDSWITH` | contains / prefix / suffix | `short_descriptionLIKEmail` |
| `IN` / `NOT IN` | value in / not in comma list | `stateIN1,2,3` |
| `ISEMPTY` / `ISNOTEMPTY` | null check | `assigned_toISEMPTY` |
| `^` / `^OR` / `^NQ` | AND / OR / new query (OR across groups) | `active=true^priority=1` |
| `ORDERBY` / `ORDERBYDESC` | ascending / descending sort | `ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on` |

```bash
# Priority 1 or 2, active, newest first
sn table list incident --query "active=true^priority=1^ORpriority=2^ORDERBYDESCsys_created_on" --limit 20
# Assigned to a user (sys_id) or unassigned
sn table list incident --query "assigned_to=6816f79c...^ORassigned_toISEMPTY"
```

## Comments & work notes (`journal`)

```bash
sn journal incident <sys_id>                  # entries newest first
sn journal incident <sys_id> --comments       # or --work-notes (mutually exclusive)
sn journal incident <sys_id> --limit 5        # newest 5 only
sn journal incident <sys_id> --raw            # the unparsed rendered stream (JSON string)
sn journal incident <sys_id> --source table   # exact sys_journal_field rows
```

Output is an array of `{created_on, author, element, label, text}`, newest
first. `element` is the journal column (`comments` / `work_notes`); `label` is
the rendered field label the entry carried ("Comments", "Work notes",
"Additional comments" — instance-dependent).

Why two sources: journal entries live one-per-row in `sys_journal_field`, but
that table is ACL-locked for non-admin roles — the row *count* survives the
ACLs, the rows do not. The default `--source record` therefore reads the
record's rendered journal stream (readable by any role that can read the
record) and parses it; its timestamps are in the calling user's timezone and
date format. `--source table` returns the exact rows — UTC timestamps,
usernames instead of display names, no `label` — when the profile's ACLs allow;
if rows exist but all were filtered, the command exits 2 naming the cause and
pointing back at `--source record`, rather than emitting a misleading `[]`.

There is no `journal add`: writing an entry is a plain field write —
`sn table update incident <sys_id> --field work_notes="checked the router"`.

## Catalog variables (`variables`)

```bash
sn variables get sc_req_item <sys_id>                        # [{name, label, value}] sorted by name
sn variables get incident <sys_id>                           # record-producer answers
sn variables set sc_req_item <sys_id> --field acrobat=true   # write + verify
sn variables set sc_req_item <sys_id> --data '{"Additional_software_requirements": "..."}'
```

Reads walk whichever join holds the values: `sc_item_option` via
`sc_item_option_mtom` for an RITM, `question_answer` (keyed by
`table_name`/`table_sys_id`) for a record produced by a record producer.

Writes go through `PUT /api/sn_sc/servicecatalog/variables/{table}/{sys_id}` —
an undocumented scripted REST resource, but the only write path open to
non-admin roles: direct Table API writes to `sc_item_option` are 403 for a
plain `itil` user, while this endpoint gates on write access to the parent
record itself. Its failure mode is silence — unknown names, wrong case, or a
record that does not own the variables all return 200 with nothing written. So
`set` restores the exit-code contract: it validates names against a read of the
pool first (unknown → exit 1 listing the real names, before any write), then
re-reads after the PUT and diffs — success reports
`{updated: {name: {from, to}}, unchanged: {...}}`, and a value that did not
persist (read-only variable, value normalization) is exit 2 naming the keys.

Variable names are case-sensitive; values are raw (reference → sys_id,
checkbox → `true`/`false`, dates in internal format). An `sc_task` target is
resolved to its `request_item` automatically — the task does not own its RITM's
variable pool, and writing to it directly would be silently skipped — with the
hop reported as `resolved_from`. Multi-row variable sets
(`sc_multi_row_question_answer`) are out of scope: they store row JSON, not
per-variable values.

## Writing records (`create`, `update`, `delete`)

**Body input** — two mutually exclusive ways (mixing them is exit 1):
- `--field name=value` (repeatable): cleanest for a few fields, no JSON
  escaping. Values are sent as strings; ServiceNow coerces per column type.
- `--data`: full JSON payload — needed for nested objects, arrays, or explicit
  nulls. Accepts inline JSON, `@file`, or `@-` (stdin).

```bash
sn table create incident --field short_description="Server CPU spike" --field caller_id=6816f79c... --field urgency=2
sn table create incident --data '{"short_description":"Printer jam in 3B","urgency":"3"}'
sn table create incident --data @body.json
jq -n '{short_description:"from pipe",urgency:"3"}' | sn table create incident --data @-
```

**`update` = PATCH** — only the named fields change; everything else is
untouched. Almost always what you want:

```bash
sn table update incident c7d8e9f0a1b2 --field state=2 --field work_notes="Investigating"
```

`update` is the **only** write verb. There is no `replace`: it issued PUT where
`update` issues PATCH, but ServiceNow applies both as partial updates — omitted
fields keep their values and nothing is blanked — so the two did the same thing
while implying they did not. It was removed in 0.11.0; `sn table replace` now
exits 1. Anything that called it should call `update` with the same body.

To clear a field, send it explicitly empty: `--field description=""`.

**`delete`** returns exit 0 with empty stdout. Non-interactive runs must pass
`--yes` — without it, a non-TTY invocation exits 1 with a usage error (a TTY
gets a `[y/N]` prompt):

```bash
sn table delete incident c7d8e9f0a1b2 --yes
```

**The guard is not only on `delete`.** Eleven commands are gated, six of them
destroying something without the word "delete" anywhere in the argv:

| command | refusal message without `--yes` |
|---|---|
| `table delete` | `delete incident/abc requires --yes when stdin is not a terminal` |
| `change delete` | `delete change abc requires --yes …` |
| `change task delete` | `delete task t1 on change c1 requires --yes …` |
| `change conflict remove` | `remove all conflicts on change abc requires --yes …` |
| `attachment delete` | `delete attachment abc requires --yes …` |
| `cmdb relation delete` | `delete relation rel1 on cmdb_ci_server/abc requires --yes …` |
| `catalog cart-remove` | `remove cart item abc requires --yes …` |
| `catalog cart-empty` | `empty cart abc requires --yes …` |
| `updateset back-out` | `back out update set abc requires --yes …` |
| `app rollback` | `roll back app x_myapp to version 1.1.0 requires --yes …` |
| `profile remove` | `remove profile ci2 and its stored credentials requires --yes …` |

The message names the verb the command uses and the target it was about to act
on, so a refusal is enough to tell whether adding `--yes` is what you meant.
`back-out` and `rollback` are gated despite being writes rather than deletes:
both are one flag, instance-wide, asynchronous, and have no second confirmation
anywhere downstream — a back-out reverts every record its set applied, and
neither has an undo of its own.

**Writing by display value:** if you have a label ("In Progress") instead of a
raw value ("2"), add `--input-display-value` so ServiceNow resolves labels on
input. Resolution can be ambiguous (two users named "Alice"); prefer raw sys_ids
for references.

```bash
sn table update incident c7d8e9f0a1b2 --input-display-value --field state="In Progress"
```

On writes, `--fields` narrows only the *response*, never the request body.

## Session context (`context`)

Every tracked write (`sys_script`, `sys_properties`, dictionary, ACLs, …) is
captured under the API account's **current application scope and update set**
— per-user, server-side state you otherwise never see over REST. `sn context`
reads it in one API round trip; the setters move it and verify by re-read.

```bash
sn context                                  # where would my tracked writes land?
```
```json
{"scope":{"sys_id":"global","name":"Global","scope":"global"},
 "update_set":{"sys_id":"0c4d…a438","name":"Default","source":"preference"}}
```

```bash
sn context scope x_myapp_scope              # by scope name, display name, or sys_id
sn context updateset "Sprint 12 fixes"      # by name or sys_id; in-progress, current scope only
```

Setters report the full new context plus a `previous` block. Switching scope
also moves the update set to the target scope's remembered (or default) set —
the same coupling the UI pickers apply.

- `source` names how the current update set was resolved: `preference` (the
  raw preference, agreeing with the scope), `scope-memory` (the scope's
  remembered set), or `scope-default`. Anything but `preference` comes with
  `preference_stale: true` — the raw preference points at another scope's set
  and the next picker interaction would heal it; `sn context updateset <name>`
  heals it explicitly. `update_set: null` plus a `note` means nothing
  resolved for the scope.
- **This surface needs scope/update-set read access** (admin or delegated
  developer). For a plain `itil` account the row ACLs return empty results,
  which the command reports as an explicit error (exit 2) instead of a
  fabricated context.
- A cross-scope or completed update set is refused with the reason; only
  in-progress sets in the current scope are selectable, matching the UI.

## Shared parameter reference

Friendly flags map to ServiceNow `sysparm_*` params; both names work. These
apply across `table` and most other command groups.

| Friendly flag | sysparm | Applies to | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--query <EQ>` | `sysparm_query` | list | Encoded query |
| `--fields <csv>` | `sysparm_fields` | list/get/create/update | Columns to return |
| `--setlimit <N>` | `sysparm_limit` | list | Max/page; default 1000 (`table`/`change`/`cmdb` list) or 100 (`change task`, `attachment`, `catalog categories`/`items`). Aliases `--limit`, `--page-size` |
| `--offset <N>` | `sysparm_offset` | list | Page offset |
| `--display-value <false\|true\|all>` | `sysparm_display_value` | list/get/create/update | See Display values |
| `--input-display-value` | `sysparm_input_display_value` | create/update | Resolve labels in request body |
| `--exclude-reference-link` | `sysparm_exclude_reference_link` | list/get/create/update | Drop `link` URL from references |
| `--view <name>` | `sysparm_view` | list/get | Named form/list view |
| `--query-no-domain` | `sysparm_query_no_domain` | list/get/update/delete | Cross-domain if authorized |
| `--no-count` / `--suppress-pagination-header` | `sysparm_no_count` / `sysparm_suppress_pagination_header` | list | Skip count query (faster on big tables) |
| `--suppress-auto-sys-field` | `sysparm_suppress_auto_sys_field` | create/update | Skip system-field auto-gen |
| `--all` / `--array` / `--max-records <N>` | (CLI only) | list | Auto-paginate / array output / cap |
| `--query-category <cat>` | `sysparm_query_category` | list | Index selection |
| `--output`, `--profile`, `-d`/`-dd`/`-ddd` | (CLI only) | all | See relevant sections |
| `--yes` / `-y` | (CLI only) | **destructive subcommands only** — not global | Skip the confirmation; required on a non-TTY. Every `delete`, plus `change conflict remove`, `catalog cart-remove`/`cart-empty`, `updateset back-out`, `app rollback`, `profile remove` |

## Aggregate

`sn aggregate` → `GET /api/now/stats/{table}`: server-side count/sum/avg/min/max
in one round trip, instead of paginating and counting client-side.

```bash
sn aggregate incident --count                       # ungrouped → ONE object
```
```json
{"stats":{"count":"142"}}
```

```bash
sn aggregate incident --count --group-by state      # grouped → an ARRAY, one entry per group
```
```json
[
  {"groupby_fields":[{"field":"state","value":"1"}],"stats":{"count":"15"}},
  {"groupby_fields":[{"field":"state","value":"2"}],"stats":{"count":"20"}},
  {"groupby_fields":[{"field":"state","value":"7"}],"stats":{"count":"27"}}
]
```

⚠️ **`--group-by` changes the top-level type from object to array**, and
`groupby_fields` is a **sibling** of `stats`, not a member of it. The count for a
group lives at `.stats.count`, and the group's value at
`.groupby_fields[0].value` — so `jq '.stats.groupby_fields[]'` returns nothing.
To read groups:

```bash
sn aggregate incident --count --group-by state \
  | jq -r '.[] | "\(.groupby_fields[0].value)\t\(.stats.count)"'
```

`sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max` nest **per field** rather than being scalars:
`{"stats":{"sum":{"reassignment_count":"24"},"min":{"priority":"1"}}}`.

```bash
# Combine aggregations and filter server-side
sn aggregate incident --sum-fields reassignment_count --min-fields priority --max-fields priority --query "active=true"
```

Flags: `--count`, `--group-by <csv>`, `--avg-fields`/`--sum-fields`/
`--min-fields`/`--max-fields <csv>`, `--query <EQ>`, `--having <expr>`,
`--order-by <csv>`, `--display-value`.

## Change Management

`sn change` wraps `/api/sn_chg_rest/change`. Three types — **normal**,
**emergency**, **standard**; `--type` targets a type-specific endpoint (omit for
the generic one). Standard changes **require** `--template`.

⚠️ **Unlike the Table API, the Change API returns every field as a
`{display_value, value}` pair.** `.number` is an *object*, not a string:

```json
{"number":{"display_value":"CHG0000024","value":"CHG0000024"},
 "state":{"display_value":"Closed","value":3.0}}
```

So `jq -r '.number'` prints a JSON blob, not `CHG0000024` — you want
`jq -r '.number.value'`. Note `state.value` comes back as a **number** (`3.0`),
while the Table API would give you the string `"3"`.

```bash
sn change list --type normal --query "state=1^priority<=2" --setlimit 10
sn change get chg001 --type normal
sn change create --type normal --field short_description="DB migration" --field category=software
sn change create --type standard --template <template_sys_id>
sn change update chg001 --field state=2
sn change delete chg001 --yes
```

**Workflow** — call `nextstates` before changing state to avoid
invalid-transition errors:

```bash
sn change nextstates chg001
# {"available_states":["3"],"state_label":{"3":"Closed"},"state_transitions":[]}
#   ^ an OBJECT, not a list of {value,label}: the legal next states are the strings
#     in .available_states, and .state_label maps each to its display name.
#     e.g.  jq -r '.available_states[] as $s | "\($s)\t\(.state_label[$s])"'
sn change approvals chg001 --field approval="approved"
sn change risk chg001 --data '{"risk_value":"moderate"}'
sn change schedule chg001
sn change models          # browse change models
sn change templates       # browse standard-change templates
```

**Sub-resources** — tasks, affected CIs, conflicts:

```bash
sn change task list <change_sys_id>
sn change task create <change_sys_id> --field short_description="Pre-check"
sn change task update <change_sys_id> <task_sys_id> --field state=2
sn change task delete <change_sys_id> <task_sys_id> --yes
sn change ci list <change_sys_id>
sn change ci add <change_sys_id> --data '{"cmdb_ci_sys_id":"<ci_id>"}'
sn change conflict get <sys_id>          # also: conflict add
sn change conflict remove <sys_id> --yes # clears EVERY conflict on the change — it takes no conflict id
```

## Attachments

`sn attachment` wraps `/api/now/attachment` — binary upload/download for any
record. Content type is auto-detected from file extension; override with
`--content-type`.

```bash
sn attachment list --query "table_name=incident" --setlimit 20
sn attachment get att001
sn attachment upload --table incident --record <record_sys_id> --file ./report.pdf
sn attachment download att001 --out ./downloaded.png       # {"path":"./downloaded.png","size":245760}
sn attachment download att001 > file.bin                   # or raw bytes to stdout
sn attachment delete att001 --yes
```

**Downloads stream**, through a fixed 64 KiB buffer — peak memory is flat in the
attachment's size (800 MB measured at 19 MB RSS), so there is no size at which
you need a different tool.

Three consequences worth planning for:

- **`--timeout` means something different here.** On every other command it caps
  the whole request; on a download it becomes a *per-read* idle timeout, because
  the body is read chunk by chunk. A slow-but-alive transfer runs as long as it
  needs and no longer dies at 30s; a stalled socket still fails 30s after the
  last byte. The header phase is capped as before, so a 404 or a 401 still fails
  fast.
- **`--out` never leaves a truncated file at the destination.** Bytes go to a
  hidden `.<name>.sn<pid>-<nanos>.part` staged in the destination's own
  directory and are renamed on success (same filesystem, so the rename is
  atomic). A failed download exits nonzero, removes the staging file, and leaves
  a **pre-existing file at that path byte-for-byte untouched** — so "the file is
  there and complete" and "the download succeeded" are the same statement, and a
  retry is always safe. Ctrl-C unlinks the staging file and exits **130**.
- **stdout has no such protection.** Bytes on a pipe cannot be recalled, so a
  mid-stream failure is exit 3 with an envelope naming how many truncated bytes
  already went out. Use `--out` for anything large or anything a later step
  depends on.

## CMDB

`sn cmdb` combines the Instance API (`/api/now/cmdb/instance/{class}`, CRUD +
relations) and Meta API (`/api/now/cmdb/meta/{class}`, schema). The class name
is always the first positional arg.

```bash
sn cmdb list cmdb_ci_server --query "operational_status=1" --setlimit 10
sn cmdb get cmdb_ci_server ci001                        # includes relations
sn cmdb create cmdb_ci_server --field name=web-server-02 --field ip_address=10.0.1.51
sn cmdb update cmdb_ci_server ci001 --field operational_status=2   # PATCH; the only write verb
sn cmdb meta cmdb_ci_server                             # class schema
sn cmdb relation add cmdb_ci_server ci001 --data '{"outbound_relations":[{"type":"<cmdb_rel_type_sys_id>","target":"<target_ci_sys_id>"}]}'
sn cmdb relation delete cmdb_ci_server ci001 <rel_sys_id> --yes
```

**Writes go out in the IRE envelope this API requires** — `{"attributes": {...},
"source": "..."}` — and `sn` builds it for you. Give `create`/`update` flat
fields exactly as on `table`; a flat `--data` body is wrapped the same way. That
is new: earlier releases sent the flat body as-is, so `--field` on `cmdb` could
not work at all (PATCH answered HTTP 500 `"attributes" is null`, POST a 400).

- **`--source` is the record's provenance**, defaulting to `"Manual Entry"` —
  which is what a CLI write literally is. It lands in `discovery_source` on the
  record. Name a real source only when standing in for that tool: the IRE
  reconciles by source, so a borrowed name lets that tool's next run silently
  overwrite what you wrote. Valid values are the choices on
  `cmdb_ci.discovery_source` (`sn schema choices cmdb_ci discovery_source`); a
  bad one fails server-side with the instance's list in `detail`.
- **Attribute values are sent as strings.** ServiceNow casts each to a Java
  `String` on the way to the record, so a JSON number or boolean is an HTTP 500
  (`class java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to class java.lang.String`). `sn`
  stringifies numbers and booleans for you — `--field cpu_count=8` goes out as
  `"8"` — leaves `null` alone (the API accepts it, so it still clears a field),
  and refuses an object or array with exit 1 naming the attribute.
- **A body whose `attributes` is a JSON object is treated as an envelope you
  wrote yourself** and passed through untouched. That is the only way to send
  `inbound_relations`/`outbound_relations` on create. The rule keys off the
  value's *type*, not the key's presence, because 718 CMDB classes on a stock
  Zurich instance carry a real column named `attributes`, and every one of them
  is String or Field List — never an object on the wire, and not something
  `--field` can produce at all. So `--field attributes=raid=6` writes that
  column, as intended.
- **A flat body's top-level `source` is exit 1, not a silent choice.** To this
  API a top-level `source` is provenance, never an attribute, and demoting it
  into `attributes` made the instance drop it and stamp the default instead —
  exit 0, wrong provenance, nothing said. Pass provenance as `--source`, or
  write a class's own `source` column with an explicit envelope:
  `{"attributes": {"source": "..."}, "source": "<provenance>"}`. Giving it both
  ways is also exit 1.

```bash
sn cmdb create cmdb_ci_linux_server --field name=web-01 --field cpu_count=8
# → {"attributes":{ ..., "cpu_count":"8", "discovery_source":"Manual Entry", ...}}
sn cmdb update cmdb_ci_server ci001 --field operational_status=2 --source "Other Automated"
```

⚠️ **`cmdb get` nests the CI's fields under `attributes`.** The top level has
exactly three keys — `attributes`, `inbound_relations`, `outbound_relations` — so
the CI's name is `.attributes.name`, not `.name`:

```bash
sn cmdb get cmdb_ci_server ci001 | jq -r '.attributes.name'
sn cmdb get cmdb_ci_server ci001 | jq '.outbound_relations[] | {type, target}'
```

## Import Sets

`sn import` wraps `/api/now/import/{stagingTable}` — loads data through transform
maps. The result reports each transform outcome (`status`: `inserted`,
`updated`, `skipped`, or `error`).

```bash
sn import create u_my_staging_table --field u_name="Server-01" --field u_ip="10.0.1.1"
sn import bulk u_my_staging_table --data '[{"u_name":"Server-01","u_ip":"10.0.1.1"},{"u_name":"Server-02","u_ip":"10.0.1.2"}]'
sn import bulk u_my_staging_table --data @records.json
sn import get u_my_staging_table imp001
```

## Service Catalog

`sn catalog` wraps `/api/sn_sc/servicecatalog` — browse, cart, order. Call
`item-variables` before ordering to discover required form fields (those with
`mandatory: true` must be in the order payload).

```bash
# Browse
sn catalog list [--text "IT"]
sn catalog get <catalog_sys_id>
sn catalog categories <catalog_sys_id> [--top-level-only]
sn catalog category <category_sys_id>
sn catalog items --text "laptop" [--category <id>] [--catalog <id>]
sn catalog item <item_sys_id>
sn catalog item-variables <item_sys_id>
```

Two ordering paths — **order now** (immediate) or the **cart workflow**:

```bash
sn catalog order <item_sys_id> --data '{"sysparm_quantity":"1","variables":{"urgency":"high"}}'  # {"request_number":"REQ0010001","request_id":"req001"}

sn catalog add-to-cart <item_sys_id> --data '{"sysparm_quantity":"1"}'
sn catalog cart                         # view; then cart-update <id>
sn catalog cart-remove <cart_item_id> --yes    # one line; --yes required on a non-TTY
sn catalog cart-empty <cart_sys_id> --yes      # the whole cart, and nothing restores it
sn catalog checkout                     # validate
sn catalog submit-order                 # place order
sn catalog wishlist
```

## Identification & Reconciliation

`sn identify` wraps `/api/now/identifyreconcile` — CI create/update through the
reconciliation engine, which decides insert-vs-update from identification rules.
POST-only; all operations take `--data` for the items payload.

```bash
sn identify create-update --data '{"items":[{"className":"cmdb_ci_server","values":{"name":"web-01","ip_address":"10.0.1.1"}}]}'
```
```json
{"items":[{"sysId":"ci001","className":"cmdb_ci_server","operation":"INSERT","identifierEntrySysId":"id001"}]}
```

```bash
sn identify query --data '{"items":[{"className":"cmdb_ci_server","values":{"name":"web-01"}}]}'   # identify without modifying
```

**Enhanced variants** support partial payloads/commits via `--options`
(comma-separated `key:value`) and `--data-source <name>` (tags the audit trail):

```bash
sn identify create-update-enhanced --data @payload.json --data-source "my_discovery" --options "partial_payload:true,partial_commits:true"
sn identify query-enhanced --data @query.json
```

## CICD (app, updateset, atf)

`app`, `updateset`, and `atf run` are **asynchronous** — they return a progress
object with `links.progress.id` immediately. `status` codes: `0` Pending, `1`
Running, `2` Successful, `3` Failed, `4` Cancelled.

**Preferred: `--wait`** blocks until the operation finishes (polling
`GET /api/sn_cicd/progress/{id}` every 2s internally), then emits the final
progress result. `--wait-timeout <SECS>` bounds the wait; on expiry the command
exits 3 pointing you to `sn progress <id>`. `--output raw` and `--output table`
are honored under `--wait` — raw used to make `--wait` a silent no-op that
emitted the initial, unpolled response.

**Branch on the exit code, never on `status_label`.** `--wait` returns 0 *only* when
`status` reaches `2`. A failed operation is **exit 2 with empty stdout** (the progress
object is on stderr, under `.error.sn_error`); a timeout is **exit 3, also empty
stdout**. So reading the command's stdout on a failure branch gets you an empty
string:

```bash
if out=$(sn app install --scope x_myapp --version 1.2.0 --wait --wait-timeout 300 2>/tmp/sn.err); then
  echo "installed"                                    # exit 0 ⇒ status "2", nothing else to check
else
  case $? in
    2) jq -r '.error.message' /tmp/sn.err >&2 ;;      # failed — details in .error.sn_error
    3) echo "timed out; still running — poll: sn progress <id>" >&2 ;;
  esac
  exit 1
fi
```

Final `--wait` stdout on success:
`{"status":"2","status_label":"Successful","status_message":"...","percent_complete":"100"}`.

⚠️ **`status_label` is ServiceNow's own string, passed through verbatim — `sn` never
normalizes it.** It varies by instance and operation ("Successful", "Complete",
"Succeeded"…). Matching on it is how you write a poll loop that never terminates.
The numeric `status` is the contract; the label is for humans.

**Manual polling** (for an operation already in flight) — key off `status`:

```bash
while r=$(sn progress "$id"); do
  case "$(jq -r '.status' <<<"$r")" in
    2)   break ;;                                              # successful
    3|4) jq -r '.status_message' <<<"$r" >&2; exit 1 ;;        # failed / cancelled
    *)   sleep 5 ;;                                            # 0 pending, 1 running
  esac
done
```

**App lifecycle** — install/publish/rollback scoped apps, identified by
`--scope` or `--sys-id`:

```bash
sn app install  --scope x_myapp --version 1.2.0 --wait
sn app publish  --scope x_myapp --version 1.3.0 --dev-notes "Fix approval NPE" --wait
sn app rollback --scope x_myapp --version 1.1.0 --wait --yes     # --version and --yes both required
```

**Update Set lifecycle** — create → (make changes) → retrieve → preview → commit:

```bash
sn updateset create --name "Sprint 42" --description "ITSM tweaks"            # {"sys_id":"...","state":"in progress"}
sn updateset retrieve --update-set-id <remote_sys_id> --auto-preview --wait   # --auto-preview previews right after retrieval
sn updateset preview <remote_id> --wait
sn updateset commit  <remote_id> --wait
sn updateset commit-multiple --ids id1,id2,id3
sn updateset back-out --update-set-id <sys_id> [--rollback-installs] --wait --yes   # reverts every record the set applied
```

**ATF** — run a suite by name or id, then fetch detailed results by result sys_id:

```bash
sn atf run --suite-name "Regression Suite" --wait     # or --suite-id; also --browser-name, --run-in-cloud, --performance-run
sn atf results <result_id>                            # {"status":"success","tests_total":38,"tests_passed":38,"tests_failed":0}
```

## Performance Analytics scorecards

`sn scores list` → `GET /api/now/pa/scorecards`. Paginate with
`--per-page`/`--page`.

```bash
sn scores list --per-page 20 --sort-by VALUE --sort-dir DESC
```
```json
[{"uuid":"indicator-uuid-1","name":"MTTR - Incidents","value":4.2,"target":6.0,
  "direction":2,"direction_label":"Minimize","frequency":10,"frequency_label":"Daily"}]
```

⚠️ `direction` and `frequency` are **integer codes**, not words. The human strings
are in `direction_label` / `frequency_label` — read those, not the numbers.

```bash
sn scores list --uuid <indicator_id> --include-scores --from 2026-01-01 --to 2026-04-01   # historical series
sn scores favorite <uuid>       # or: sn scores unfavorite <uuid>
```

Filters: `--uuid <csv>`, `--favorites`, `--key`, `--target`, `--contains <csv>`,
`--sort-by VALUE|CHANGE|CHANGEPERC|GAP|NAME|DATE|…`, `--sort-dir ASC|DESC`,
`--include-scores` (with `--from`/`--to`), `--include-available-breakdowns`,
`--include-realtime`.

## Utility & extension commands

```bash
sn ping                                  # health check (auth + latency + identity + build); see `sn ping`
sn user me                               # the caller's own sys_user record, read by sys_id
sn api list|search|spec                  # which REST APIs this instance publishes; see Finding an API
sn open incident a1b2c3 [--print-url]    # open the record's form in a browser; --print-url prints the URL instead
sn raw GET /api/now/table/incident --query sysparm_limit=5      # REST passthrough for unmodeled endpoints
sn raw POST /api/now/table/incident --data '{"short_description":"via raw"}'
sn raw GET /api/now/table/incident -H 'X-no-response-body: true'   # repeatable request headers
sn graphql 'query { GlideRecord_Query { incident(pagination: {limit: 5}) { _rowCount _results { number { value } } } } }'
sn graphql @query.graphql --var id=a1b2c3 --variables '{"limit": 5}'   # document from file; string + typed variables
sn completion zsh                        # shell completion script (bash|zsh|fish|powershell|elvish) to stdout
sn introspect                            # full command tree as JSON — auto-generate MCP / function-call schemas
```

`sn user me` asks the instance for the caller's sys_id and reads that one
`sys_user` row — no `javascript:` term on the wire, so the query cannot be
silently dropped. On an instance that can't name the caller it falls back to the
scripted read, and if *that* query is dropped (proved by a second row coming
back for a unique `user_name`) it exits **2 with no `status_code`** rather than
handing you a stranger's record.

`sn raw <METHOD> <PATH>` applies the active profile's auth/proxy/TLS and the
standard output/error contract; use it for endpoints `sn` doesn't model.

`sn graphql <QUERY>` runs a GraphQL document against `POST /api/now/graphql` —
the whole surface, including the generated `GlideRecord_Query` /
`GlideRecord_Mutation` / `GlideAggregateRecord_Query` namespaces (a query field
and CRUD mutations for every table; per-field display values, `_choices` on
choice fields, `_table_metadata` ACL verdicts, `_reference` dot-walking,
`_rowCount` totals alongside a page). The document comes inline, from `@file`,
or `@-` (stdin). On success stdout gets `data` unwrapped (`--output raw` keeps
the envelope). GraphQL reports failure **in-band** — HTTP 200 with an `errors`
array, sometimes next to partial `data` — so a response with errors exits 2
with the full array under `sn_error`, and partial `data` still reaches stdout
first. `--var k=v` sets a string variable (repeatable; only the first `=`
splits, so encoded queries pass through). `--variables '{...}'` supplies a JSON
object for non-string variables; `--var` entries overlay it. Prefer variables
over splicing values into the document — a sys_id in `--var` can't break query
syntax.
`sn introspect` emits the whole command tree as **one recursive object** —
`{name, about, args[], subcommands[]}`, with `subcommands` nesting the same shape
all the way down. There is **no** top-level `commands` array (`jq '.commands[]'`
fails with "Cannot iterate over null"), and no `summary`, `flags`, or `exit_codes`
key: the help string is `about`, and every option lives in `args[]`.

```bash
# Flatten the tree to every command and its help text:
sn introspect | jq '[.. | objects | select(has("subcommands")) | {name, about}]'

# What flags does `table list` take?
sn introspect | jq '.subcommands[] | select(.name=="table")
                    | .subcommands[] | select(.name=="list") | .args[].name'
```

Each entry in `args[]` carries `name`, `long`, `short`, `help`, `help_heading`,
`required`, `takes_value`, `value_name`, `positional`, `repeatable`, `aliases`,
`default_values`, `possible_values`, and `conflicts_with` — enough to generate
an MCP tool or function-call schema. The help string is `help`, not `about`;
`about` is the *command's* description. A `takes_value: false` arg is a
valueless switch: emit `--all`, never `--all true`.

The root carries two extra keys: `version` (the binary that produced the tree)
and `global_args` (the 11 flags clap propagates to every command). **A command's
effective flags are its own `args` plus the root's `global_args`** — non-global
args do not propagate, so there is no ancestor chain to walk. They sit at the
root because repeating them on all 130 nodes was three quarters of the output.

```bash
# Everything `table list` accepts:
sn introspect | jq '[.global_args[], (.subcommands[] | select(.name=="table")
                     | .subcommands[] | select(.name=="list") | .args[])]
                    | map(.name)'
```

`conflicts_with` lists the arg ids that cannot be combined with this one, so a
generator never emits `--data` alongside `--field` (exit 1). Its inverse is
**not** available: clap keeps `requires` private, so `--wait-timeout` requiring
`--wait` appears only as prose in that flag's `help`. `help_heading` carries the
tier `--help` renders — `Global options`, `Advanced options`, or `null` for a
command's working set.

Those tiers are the same ones `sn <command> --help` prints, in that order: the
command's own flags first (unheaded, ordered by usefulness), then **Advanced
options** — raw `sysparm_*` passthroughs like `--view`, `--query-category`,
`--query-no-domain`, `--no-count` that most callers never touch — then **Global
options**, the 11 flags every command accepts. When scanning help output for the
flag you want, the first block is almost always the one that matters.

`--help` and `--version` are omitted: they exit before any handler runs, so
there is nothing for a generated tool to call. Nothing named `help` appears in
the tree at all — clap's `help` subcommand mirrors every command as an
argument-less stub, and emitting it gave each real command a same-named twin.

## Common mistakes

- **Echoing a read straight back into a write or a `--query`** → `--display-value`
  defaults to **`true`**, so you are holding `"In Progress"` and a localized date
  like `08/04/2026 10:22:01 AM`, neither of which ServiceNow will accept back.
  Read with `--display-value false` (or `all`, and send the `value` side).
- **Reaching for `replace`** → it was removed in 0.11.0 and exits 1. `update` is
  the only write verb; PUT and PATCH were both partial updates, so the two did
  the same thing. Clear a field explicitly (`--field x=""`).
- **Mixing `--data` and `--field`** → exit 1. Pick one.
- **`--query` on `get`** → `get` takes a sys_id only; use `list --limit 1 --query "..."`.
- **Missing `--yes` on a destructive command** in CI/agent contexts → immediate
  exit 1 usage error (non-TTY never prompts). Every `delete` subcommand, plus
  `change conflict remove`, `catalog cart-remove`/`cart-empty`, `updateset
  back-out`, `app rollback` and `profile remove`.
- **Treating every exit 4 as "log in again"** → 403 is exit 4 too, and an ACL
  denial does not get better with a fresh token. Check `.error.status_code`.
- **Combining `--all` with `--output raw` or `--output table`** → exit 1. Use
  `--array` for a table; page manually if you need the envelope.
- **Comparing `.error.status_code` without allowing for its absence** → it is
  omitted, not zeroed, when the failure carried no HTTP status.
- **Sending a display value as raw** → `--field state="In Progress"` without
  `--input-display-value` fails; send `state=2`.
- **Paginating by hand** → use `--all` (with `--max-records` as a guard rail);
  never compute offsets.
- **Trusting `sn_error` on transport errors (exit 3)** → it's null/absent; check
  `.error.message`.
- **Pulling more than you need** → `--setlimit` defaults to 1000 on the main list commands; lower it for
  exploration.

## Claude Code plugin

`sn` ships as a Claude Code plugin that pre-approves `Bash(sn *)` (no per-call
permission prompts). Repos that clone it load the local skill at
`.claude/skills/sn.md` automatically (invoke with `/sn`). To install it as a
plugin elsewhere, add this repo as a marketplace (`claude plugin marketplace
add tehubersheezy/servicenow-cli`, or a local clone path), then
`claude plugin install sn`.
